\caption{Overview of the three configurations used for the combined system which makes a prediction for whether \Comment{} is inconsistent ($P_{inconsistent}$) as well for the updated comment ($P_{comment}$). Modules are trained on either the full training set, including positive/inconsistent (+) and negative/consistent (-) examples, or only positive examples.}
