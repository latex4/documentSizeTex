abstract="This chapter introduces privacy and data protection by design, and reviews privacy-enhancing techniques (PETs). Although privacy by design includes both technical and operational measures, the chapter focuses on the technical measures. First, it enumerates design strategies. Next, it considers privacy-enhancing techniques that directly address the hide strategy, but also aid in implementing the separate, control and enforce strategies. Specifically, it addresses PETs for: (1) identification, authentication and anonymity; (2) private communications; (3) privacy-preserving computations; (4) privacy in databases; and (5) discrimination prevention in data mining.",

abstract="The focus of this chapter is the false non-match rate. The false non-match rate (FNMR) is the rate at which a biometric matcher miscategorizes two signals from the same individual as being from different individuals. In this chapter, we focus on statistical methods for estimation and hypothesis testing of FNMR rates. We start with the notation and the correlation structure that we will use throughout the chapter. We then present statistical methods for estimating and comparing FNMR's. This includes confidence interval and hypothesis testing for a single FNMR as well as for comparing two or more FNMR's. These methods are done using both large sample as well as non-parametric methods. A discussion of sample size and power calculation follows that section. We conclude this chapter with a section on prediction intervals and a discussion section.",
