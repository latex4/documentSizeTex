 abstract = {The possible links between music and language continue to intrigue scientists interested in the nature of these two types of knowledge, their evolution, and their instantiation in the brain. Here we consider music and language from a developmental perspective, focusing on the degree to which similar mechanisms of learning and memory might subserve the acquisition of knowledge in these two domains. In particular, it seems possible that while adult musical and linguistic processes are modularized to some extent as separate entities, there may be similar developmental underpinnings in both domains, suggesting that modularity is emergent rather than present at the beginning of life. Directions for future research are considered.},

abstract = {AI music composition is one of the most attractive and important topics in artificial intelligence, music, and multimedia. The typical tasks in AI music composition include melody generation, song writing, accompaniment generation, arrangement, performance generation, timbre rendering, sound generation, and singing voice synthesis, which cover different modalities (e.g., symbolic music score, sound) and well match to the theme of ACM Multimedia. As the rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques such as content creation and deep learning, AI based music composition has achieved rapid progress, but still encountered a lot of challenges. A thorough introduction and review on the basics, the research progress, as well as how to address the challenges in AI music composition are timely and necessary for a broad audience working on artificial intelligence, music, and multimedia. In this tutorial, we will first introduce the background of AI music composition, including music basics and deep learning techniques for music composition. Then we will introduce AI music composition from two perspectives: 1) key components, which include music score generation, music performance generation, and music sound generation; 2) advanced topics, which include music structure/form/style/emotion modeling, timbre synthesis/transfer/mixing, etc. At last, we will point out some research challenges and future directions in AI music composition. This tutorial can serve both academic researchers and industry practitioners working on AI music composition.},
