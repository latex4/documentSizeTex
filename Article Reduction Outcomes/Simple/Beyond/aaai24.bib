	abstract={A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

	abstract="Machine learning and data mining techniques have been used in numerous real-world applications. An assumption of traditional machine learning methodologies is the training data and testing data are taken from the same domain, such that the input feature space and data distribution characteristics are the same. However, in some real-world machine learning scenarios, this assumption does not hold. There are cases where training data is expensive or difficult to collect. Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred to as transfer learning. This survey paper formally defines transfer learning, presents information on current solutions, and reviews applications applied to transfer learning. Lastly, there is information listed on software downloads for various transfer learning solutions and a discussion of possible future research work. The transfer learning solutions surveyed are independent of data size and can be applied to big data environments.",

	abstract={Domain transfer learning, which learns a target classifier using labeled data from a different distribution, has shown promising value in knowledge discovery yet still been a challenging problem. Most previous works designed adaptive classifiers by exploring two learning strategies independently: distribution adaptation and label propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as Adaptation Regularization based Transfer Learning (ARTL), to model them in a unified way based on the structural risk minimization principle and the regularization theory. Specifically, ARTL learns the adaptive classifier by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk functional, the joint distribution matching between domains, and the manifold consistency underlying marginal distribution. Based on the framework, we propose two novel methods using Regularized Least Squares (RLS) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), respectively, and use the Representer theorem in reproducing kernel Hilbert space to derive corresponding solutions. Comprehensive experiments verify that ARTL can significantly outperform state-of-the-art learning methods on several public text and image datasets.},

	abstract={Transfer learning allows leveraging the knowledge of source domains, available a priori, to help training a classifier for a target domain, where the available data is scarce. The effectiveness of the transfer is affected by the relationship between source and target. Rather than improving the learning, brute force leveraging of a source poorly related to the target may decrease the classifier performance. One strategy to reduce this negative transfer is to import knowledge from multiple sources to increase the chance of finding one source closely related to the target. This work extends the boosting framework for transferring knowledge from multiple sources. Two new algorithms, MultiSource-TrAdaBoost, and TaskTrAdaBoost, are introduced, analyzed, and applied for object category recognition and specific object detection. The experiments demonstrate their improved performance by greatly reducing the negative transfer as the number of sources increases. TaskTrAdaBoost is a fast algorithm enabling rapid retraining over new targets.},

In this paper, we describe simple neural extensions of these techniques. First, we propose a natural generalization of the feature augmentation method that uses K + 1 LSTMs where one model captures global patterns across all K domains and the remaining K models capture domain-specific information. Second, we propose a novel application of the framework for learning shared structures by Ando and Zhang (2005) to domain adaptation, and also provide a neural extension of their approach. In experiments on slot tagging over 17 domains, our methods give clear performance improvement over Daum{\'e} III (2009) applied on feature-rich CRFs.",

	abstract = { The nature of manufacturing systems faces ever more complex, dynamic and at times even chaotic behaviors. In order to being able to satisfy the demand for high-quality products in an efficient manner, it is essential to utilize all means available. One area, which saw fast pace developments in terms of not only promising results but also usability, is machine learning. Promising an answer to many of the old and new challenges of manufacturing, machine learning is widely discussed by researchers and practitioners alike. However, the field is very broad and even confusing which presents a challenge and a barrier hindering wide application. Here, this paper contributes in presenting an overview of available machine learning techniques and structuring this rather complicated area. A special focus is laid on the potential benefit, and examples of successful applications in a manufacturing environment. }

	abstract="Increasing market demand towards higher product and process quality and efficiency forces companies to think of new and innovative ways to optimize their production. In the area of high-tech manufacturing products, even slight variations of the product state during production can lead to costly and time-consuming rework or even scrapage. Describing an individual product's state along the entire manufacturing programme, including all relevant information involved for utilization, e.g., in-process adjustments of process parameters, can be one way to meet the quality requirements and stay competitive. Ideally, the gathered information can be directly analyzed and in case of an identified critical trend or event, adequate action, such as an alarm, can be triggered. Traditional methods based on modelling of cause-effect relations reaches its limits due to the fast increasing complexity and high-dimensionality of modern manufacturing programmes. There is a need for new approaches that are able to cope with this complexity and high-dimensionality which, at the same time, are able to generate applicable results with reasonable effort. Within this paper, the possibility to generate such a system by applying a combination of Cluster Analysis and Supervised Machine Learning on product state data along the manufacturing programme will be presented. After elaborating on the different key aspects of the approach, the applicability on the identified problem in industrial environment will be discussed briefly.",

	abstract = 	 {The domain adaptation problem in machine learning occurs when the test data generating distribution differs from the one that generates the training data. It is clear that the success of learning under such circumstances depends on similarities between the two data distributions. We study assumptions about the relationship between the two distributions that one needed for domain adaptation learning to succeed.  We analyze the assumptions in an agnostic PAC-style learning model for a the setting in which the learner can access a labeled training data sample and an unlabeled sample generated by the test data distribution. We focus on three assumptions: (i) Similarity between the unlabeled distributions, (ii) Existence of a classifier in the hypothesis class with low error on both training and testing distributions, and (iii) The covariate shift assumption. I.e., the assumption that the conditioned label distribution (for each data point) is the same for both the training and test distributions.  We show that without either assumption (i) or (ii), the combination of the remaining assumptions is not sufficient toguarantee successful learning. Our negative results hold with respect to any domain adaptation learning algorithm, as long as it does not have access to target labeled examples.  In particular, we provide formal proofs that the popular covariate shift assumption is rather weak and does not relieve the necessity of the other assumptions.  We also discuss the intuitively appealing paradigm of reweighing the labeled training sample according to the target unlabeled distribution. We show that, somewhat counter intuitively, that paradigm cannot be trusted in the following sense. There are DA tasks that are indistinguishable, as far as the input training data goes, but in which reweighing leads to significant improvement in one task, while causing dramatic deterioration of the learning success in the other.}

Most models however, do not generalize to populations outside the marginal and conditional distribution assumptions for which they were derived. This presents a significant barrier to the deployment of machine learning techniques into wider clinical practice as most medical studies are data scarce, especially for the analysis of time-to-event outcomes. In this work we propose a survival prediction model that is able to improve predictions on a small data domain of interest - such as a local hospital - by leveraging related data from other domains - such as data from other hospitals. We construct an ensemble of weak survival predictors which iteratively adapt the marginal distributions of the source and target data such that similar source patients contribute to the fit and ultimately improve predictions on target patients of interest. This represents the first boosting-based transfer learning algorithm in the survival analysis literature. We demonstrate the performance and utility of our algorithm on synthetic and real healthcare data collected at various locations.}

When the design objective can only be measured by costly operations such as experiments or cumbersome computer simulations, a thorough design procedure can be limited. The design problem in these cases is a high cost optimization problem. Meta model-based approaches (e.g. Bayesian optimization) and transfer optimization are methods that can be used to facilitate more efficient designs. Transfer optimization is a technique that enables using previous design knowledge instead of starting from scratch in a new task. In this work, we study a transfer optimization framework based on Bayesian optimization using Gaussian Processes. The similarity among the tasks is determined via a similarity metric. The framework is applied to a particular design problem of thin film solar cells. Planar multilayer solar cells with different sets of materials are optimized to obtain the best opto-electrical efficiency. Solar cells with amorphous silicon and organic absorber layers are studied and the results are presented.}",

When the target data to be predicted is scarce, one would like to improve its prediction by employing data from the other, secondary, dataset. Transfer learning tries to address this task by suitably compensating such a dataset shift. In this work we assume that the distributions of the covariates and the dependent variables can differ arbitrarily between the datasets. We propose two methods for regression based on importance weighting. Here to each instance of the secondary data a weight is assigned such that the data contributes positively to the prediction of the target data. Experiments show that our method yields good results on benchmark and real world datasets.",

We also present a generalization of the standard on-line to batch conversion to the drifting scenario in terms of the discrepancy and arbitrary convex combinations of hypotheses.

  abstract = 	 {Recent work has shown local convergence of GAN training for absolutely continuous data and generator distributions. In this paper, we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous, unregularized GAN training is not always convergent. Furthermore, we discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that GAN training with instance noise or zero-centered gradient penalties converges. On the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new explanation for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis, we extend our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence for simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distributions lie on lower dimensional manifolds. We find these penalties to work well in practice and use them to learn high-resolution generative image models for a variety of datasets with little hyperparameter tuning.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised domain adaption from theoretical and algorithmic perspectives. Existing domain adaptation theories naturally imply minimax optimization algorithms, which connect well with the domain adaptation methods based on adversarial learning. However, several disconnections still exist and form the gap between theory and algorithm. We extend previous theories (Mansour et al., 2009c; Ben-David et al., 2010) to multiclass classification in domain adaptation, where classifiers based on the scoring functions and margin loss are standard choices in algorithm design. We introduce Margin Disparity Discrepancy, a novel measurement with rigorous generalization bounds, tailored to the distribution comparison with the asymmetric margin loss, and to the minimax optimization for easier training. Our theory can be seamlessly transformed into an adversarial learning algorithm for domain adaptation, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm achieves the state of the art accuracies on challenging domain adaptation tasks.}

abstract = {This work provides a framework for addressing the problem of supervised domain adaptation with deep models. The main idea is to exploit adversarial learning to learn an embedded subspace that simultaneously maximizes the confusion between two domains while semantically aligning their embedding. The supervised setting becomes attractive especially when there are only a few target data samples that need to be labeled. In this few-shot learning scenario, alignment and separation of semantic probability distributions is difficult because of the lack of data. We found that by carefully designing a training scheme whereby the typical binary adversarial discriminator is augmented to distinguish between four different classes, it is possible to effectively address the supervised adaptation problem. In addition, the approach has a high "speed" of adaptation, i.e. it requires an extremely low number of labeled target training samples, even one per category can be effective. We then extensively compare this approach to the state of the art in domain adaptation in two experiments: one using datasets for handwritten digit recognition, and one using datasets for visual object recognition.},

abstract = "Regression problems are pervasive in real-world applications. Generally a substantial amount of labeled samples are needed to build a regression model with good generalization ability. However, many times it is relatively easy to collect a large number of unlabeled samples, but time-consuming or expensive to label them. Active learning for regression (ALR) is a methodology to reduce the number of labeled samples, by selecting the most beneficial ones to label, instead of random selection. This paper proposes two new ALR approaches based on greedy sampling (GS). The first approach (GSy) selects new samples to increase the diversity in the output space, and the second (iGS) selects new samples to increase the diversity in both input and output spaces. Extensive experiments on 10 UCI and CMU StatLib datasets from various domains, and on 15 subjects on EEG-based driver drowsiness estimation, verified their effectiveness and robustness."

abstract = {Active learning sequentially selects unlabeled instances to label with the goal of reducing the effort needed to learn a good classifier. Most previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting one unlabeled instance to label at a time while retraining in each iteration. Recently a few batch mode active learning approaches have been proposed that select a set of most informative unlabeled instances in each iteration under the guidance of heuristic scores. In this paper, we propose a discriminative batch mode active learning approach that formulates the instance selection task as a continuous optimization problem over auxiliary instance selection variables. The optimization is formulated to maximize the discriminative classification performance of the target classifier, while also taking the unlabeled data into account. Although the objective is not convex, we can manipulate a quasi-Newton method to obtain a good local solution. Our empirical studies on UCI datasets show that the proposed active learning is more effective than current state-of-the art batch mode active learning algorithms.},

Most of the previous studies in active learning have focused on selecting a single unlabeled example in each iteration. This could be inefficient since the classification model has to be retrained for every labeled example. In this paper, we present a framework for "batch mode active learning" that applies the Fisher information matrix to select a number of informative examples simultaneously. The key computational challenge is how to efficiently identify the subset of unlabeled examples that can result in the largest reduction in the Fisher information. To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm that is based on the property of submodular functions. Our empirical studies with five UCI datasets and one real-world medical image classification show that the proposed batch mode active learning algorithm is more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms for active learning.},

This, however, is unrealistic in many real-world applications where human experts are not readily available at all times. In this paper, we consider the single shot setting: all the required samples should be chosen in a single shot and no human annotation can be exploited during the selection process. We propose a new method, Active Learning through Random Labeling (ALRL), which substitutes single human annotator for multiple, what we will refer to as, pseudo annotators. These pseudo annotators always provide uniform and random labels whenever new unlabeled samples are queried. This random labeling enables standard active learning algorithms to also exhibit the exploratory behavior needed for single shot active learning. The exploratory behavior is further enhanced by selecting the most representative sample via minimizing nearest neighbor distance between unlabeled samples and queried samples. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches."

We theoretically analyze the performance guarantee of the multi-stage framework and give examples on how to design instances of MULTGREED for a broad range of natural submodular functions. We show that MULTGREED performs very closely to the standard greedy algorithm given appropriate surrogate functions and argue how our framework can easily be integrated with distributive algorithms for further optimization. We complement our theory by empirically evaluating on several real-world problems, including data subset selection on millions of speech samples where MULTGREED yields at least a thousand times speedup and superior results over the state-of-the-art selection methods.},

abstract = {Many practical applications, such as environmental monitoring or placing sensors for event detection, require to select among a set of informative but possibly expensive observations. When monitoring spatial phenomena with sensor networks or mobile robots, for example, we need to decide which locations to observe in order to most effectively decrease the uncertainty, at minimum cost. These problems are usually NP-hard. Previous approaches for tackling these sensing problems have mainly relied on myopic heuristics, i.e., approaches which only consider the next best observation to add, without planning ahead for future sensing opportunities. For those approaches, typically no performance guarantees are known. Existing nonmyopic approaches have involved computationally intensive techniques which are very difficult to scale to larger problems. In this Thesis, we present a new class of approaches for observation selection, using techniques from combinatorial optimization. We show that many observation selection objectives satisfy  submodularity , an intuitive diminishing returns property—adding a sensor to a small deployment helps more than adding it to a large deployment. Examples include mutual information for spatial prediction and placing sensors for outbreak detection. We also develop a suite of non-greedy approaches that systematically exploit this submodularity property in order to  efficiently  obtain provably  near-optimal  solutions to complex sensing problems. For example, the chosen observations often need to be robust against sensor failure or uncertainty about model parameters. Examples include minimizing the maximum posterior variance in spatial prediction and robust experimental design. We show, that many such problems require the optimization of an adversarially chosen submodular objective function. We will demonstrate that for this problem, existing greedy algorithms perform arbitrarily badly. We develop an algorithm, S ATURATE , which performs near-optimally in this setting. In addition to the problem of finding the best  k  observations (sensor locations), we consider problems with complex combinatorial constraints. For example, when placing wireless sensor networks, the chosen locations should not only be very informative, but also allow efficient communication. When using robots for making observations, the chosen locations need to lie on a collection of paths. We present P SPIEL, an efficient algorithm which finds solutions which near-optimally trade off sensing quality and cost. When deploying wireless sensor networks, another fundamental constraint is battery lifetime. Since every measurement draws power, sensors can typically be activated only a fraction of the time. Hence, the problem of scheduling the sensors becomes of crucial importance. Traditionally, sensor placement and scheduling have been considered separately from each other. In this Thesis, we present E SPASS, an efficient algorithm for simultaneously optimizing the placement and scheduling. We show that this simultaneous approach leads to drastic improvements in network lifetime when compared to the traditional, stage-wise approach. A key question in many observation selection problems is how much better a sequential algorithm, which decides on the next observation based on previous observations, can perform when compared to the best fixed set of observations chosen a priori. We present a partial answer to the question for spatial prediction in Gaussian Processes. We develop a theoretical bound quantifying the gap between the best sequential and a priori selections, and use it to develop an exploration—exploitation approach for active learning in Gaussian Processes. Lastly, we look beyond submodular observation selection problems, and consider the problem of selecting  optimal  observations in graphical models.We show that in chain-graphical (Markovian) models, it is possible to efficiently find the optimal sequential policy. However, even for slightly larger classes of graphical models, we prove strong hardness results. In addition to providing algorithms and theoretical analyses, we present extensive empirical evaluation of our approaches on several real-world case studies. These include building a sensing chair for posture recognition, monitoring environmental phenomena with mobile robots, securing municipal water distribution networks, and selecting informative weblogs to read on the Internet.},

Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task).} }

abstract = {Active Learning is a machine learning and data mining technique that selects the most informative samples for labeling and uses them as training data; it is especially useful when there are large amount of unlabeled data and labeling them is expensive. Recently, batch-mode active learning, where a set of samples are selected concurrently for labeling, based on their collective merit, has attracted a lot of attention. The objective of batch-mode active learning is to select a set of informative samples so that a classifier learned on these samples has good generalization performance on the unlabeled data. Most of the existing batch-mode active learning methodologies try to achieve this by selecting samples based on certain criteria. In this article we propose a novel criterion which achieves good generalization performance of a classifier by specifically selecting a set of query samples that minimize the difference in distribution between the labeled and the unlabeled data, after annotation. We explicitly measure this difference based on all candidate subsets of the unlabeled data and select the best subset. The proposed objective is an NP-hard integer programming optimization problem. We provide two optimization techniques to solve this problem. In the first one, the problem is transformed into a convex quadratic programming problem and in the second method the problem is transformed into a linear programming problem. Our empirical studies using publicly available UCI datasets and two biomedical image databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art batch-mode active learning methods. We also present two extensions of the proposed approach, which incorporate uncertainty of the predicted labels of the unlabeled data and transfer learning in the proposed formulation. In addition, we present a joint optimization framework for performing both transfer and active learning simultaneously unlike the existing approaches of learning in two separate stages, that is, typically, transfer learning followed by active learning. We specifically minimize a common objective of reducing distribution difference between the domain adapted source, the queried and labeled samples and the rest of the unlabeled target domain data. Our empirical studies on two biomedical image databases and on a publicly available 20 Newsgroups dataset show that incorporation of uncertainty information and transfer learning further improves the performance of the proposed active learning based classifier. Our empirical studies also show that the proposed transfer-active method based on the joint optimization framework performs significantly better than a framework which implements transfer and active learning in two separate stages.},

abstract = {Empirical risk minimization (ERM) provides a principled guideline for many machine learning and data mining algorithms. Under the ERM principle, one minimizes an upper bound of the true risk, which is approximated by the summation of empirical risk and the complexity of the candidate classifier class. To guarantee a satisfactory learning performance, ERM requires that the training data are i.i.d. sampled from the unknown source distribution. However, this may not be the case in active learning, where one selects the most informative samples to label, and these data may not follow the source distribution. In this article, we generalize the ERM principle to the active learning setting. We derive a novel form of upper bound for the true risk in the active learning setting; by minimizing this upper bound, we develop a practical batch mode active learning method. The proposed formulation involves a nonconvex integer programming optimization problem. We solve it efficiently by an alternating optimization method. Our method is shown to query the most informative samples while preserving the source distribution as much as possible, thus identifying the most uncertain and representative queries. We further extend our method to multiclass active learning by introducing novel pseudolabels in the multiclass case and developing an efficient algorithm. Experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Domain adaptation is an important emerging topic in computer vision. In this paper, we present one of the first studies of domain shift in the context of object recognition. We introduce a method that adapts object models acquired in a particular visual domain to new imaging conditions by learning a transformation that minimizes the effect of domain-induced changes in the feature distribution. The transformation is learned in a supervised manner and can be applied to categories for which there are no labeled examples in the new domain. While we focus our evaluation on object recognition tasks, the transform-based adaptation technique we develop is general and could be applied to nonimage data. Another contribution is a new multi-domain object database, freely available for download. We experimentally demonstrate the ability of our method to improve recognition on categories with few or no target domain labels and moderate to large changes in the imaging conditions.},
