# Article Reduction Outcomes

This folder contains the organized outcomes of the papers reduction based on different algorithms. The structure is designed to facilitate easy access and analysis of the papers categorized by the type of algorithm used.

## Folder Structure

The main folder, `Article Reduction Outcomes`, contains five algorithms subfolders, each corresponding to a different algorithm category and one more folder for the results. Within each of these 5 subfolders, there are further subfolders named after the individual papers. Each paper subfolder contains the relevant files and directories associated with that paper.

### Subfolders

1. **Simple**: Contains papers and associated files where the main algorithm used is classified as "Simple".
2. **Heuristic**: Contains papers and associated files where the main algorithm used is classified as "Heuristic".
3. **Classification**: Contains papers and associated files where the main algorithm used is classified as "Classification".
4. **Regression**: Contains papers and associated files where the main algorithm used is classified as "Regression".
5. **Classification&Regression**: Contains papers and associated files where the main algorithms used are classified as both "Classification" and "Regression".
6. **results**: Contains 5 csv files of the results for each algorithm.
