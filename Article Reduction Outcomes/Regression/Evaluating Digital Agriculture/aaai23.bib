By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

	title = {Causal {Classiﬁcation}: {Treatment} {Eﬀect} {Estimation} vs. {Outcome} {Prediction}},
	abstract = {The goal of causal classiﬁcation is to identify individuals whose outcome would be positively changed by a treatment. Examples include targeting advertisements and targeting retention incentives to reduce churn. Causal classiﬁcation is challenging because we observe individuals under only one condition (treated or untreated), so we do not know who was inﬂuenced by the treatment, but we may estimate the potential outcomes under each condition to decide whom to treat by estimating treatment eﬀects. Curiously, we often see practitioners using simple outcome prediction instead, for example, predicting if someone will purchase if shown the ad. Rather than disregarding this as naive behavior, we present a theoretical analysis comparing treatment eﬀect estimation and outcome prediction when addressing causal classiﬁcation. We focus on the key question: “When (if ever) is simple outcome prediction preferable to treatment eﬀect estimation for causal classiﬁcation?” The analysis reveals a causal bias–variance tradeoﬀ. First, when the treatment eﬀect estimation depends on two outcome predictions, larger sampling variance may lead to more errors than the (biased) outcome prediction approach. Second, a stronger signal-to-noise ratio in outcome prediction implies that the bias can help with intervention decisions when outcomes are informative of eﬀects. The theoretical results, as well as simulations, illustrate settings where outcome prediction should actually be better, including cases where (1) the bias may be partially corrected by choosing a diﬀerent threshold, (2) outcomes and treatment eﬀects are correlated, and (3) data to estimate counterfactuals are limited. A major practical implication is that, for some applications, it might be feasible to make good intervention decisions without any data on how individuals actually behave when intervened. Finally, we show that for a real online advertising application, outcome prediction models indeed excel at causal classiﬁcation.},

In this paper we develop the first statistical definition of harm and a framework for factoring harm into algorithmic decisions. We argue that harm is fundamentally a counterfactual quantity, and show that standard machine learning algorithms are guaranteed to pursue harmful policies in certain environments. To resolve this, we derive a family of counterfactual objective functions that robustly mitigate for harm. We demonstrate our approach with a statistical model for identifying optimal drug doses. While identifying optimal doses using the causal treatment effect results in harmful treatment decisions, our counterfactual algorithm identifies doses that are far less harmful without sacrificing efficacy. Our results show that counterfactual reasoning is a key ingredient for safe and ethical AI.},

It is unclear how different factors causally influence regime shift or recovery trajectories after a bleaching event. Here, we use structural causal modeling (SCM) and its application of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to determine how key factors affect regime shift versus recovery potential across coral reefs in Seychelles, which were severely impacted by bleaching events in 1998 and 2016. Our causal models reveal additional causal drivers of regime shifts, including initial macroalgal cover, wave exposure, and branching coral cover. We also find that reduced depth and structural complexity and increased nutrients increase the likelihood of regime shifting. Further, we use a DAG-informed predictive model to show how recovering reefs are expected to change after a recent 2016 bleaching event, suggesting that three out of 12 recovering reefs are expected to regime shift given their predisturbance conditions. Collectively, our results provide the first causally grounded analysis of how different factors influence postbleaching regime shift versus recovery potential on coral reefs. More broadly, SCM stands apart from previous observational analysis and provides a strong framework for causal inference across other observational ecological studies.},

EC-Earth3 key performance metrics demonstrate physical behaviour and biases well within the frame known from recent CMIP models. With improved physical and dynamic features, new ESM components, community tools, and largely improved physical performance compared to the CMIP5 version, EC-Earth3 represents a clear step forward for the only European community ESM. We demonstrate here that EC-Earth3 is suited for a range of tasks in CMIP6 and beyond.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems are projected to face extreme high temperatures more frequently in the near future. Various biotic coping strategies exist to prevent heat stress. Controlled experiments have recently provided evidence for continued transpiration in woody plants during high air temperatures, even when photosynthesis is inhibited. Such a decoupling of photosynthesis and transpiration would represent an effective strategy (‘known as leaf or canopy cooling’) to prevent lethal leaf temperatures. At the ecosystem scale, continued transpiration might dampen the development and propagation of heat extremes despite further desiccating soils. However, at the ecosystem scale, evidence for the occurrence of this decoupling is still limited. Here, we aim to investigate this mechanism using eddy-covariance data of thirteen woody ecosystems located in Australia and a causal graph discovery algorithm. Working at half-hourly time resolution, we find evidence for a decoupling of photosynthesis and transpiration in four ecosystems which can be classified as Mediterranean woodlands. The decoupling occurred at air temperatures above 35 ◦C. At the nine other investigated woody sites, we found that vegetation CO2 exchange remained coupled to transpiration at the observed high air temperatures. Ecosystem characteristics suggest that the canopy energy balance plays a crucial role in determining the occurrence of a decoupling. Our results highlight the value of causal-inference approaches for the analysis of complex physiological processes. With regard to projected increasing temperatures and especially extreme events in future climates, further vegetation types might be pushed to threatening canopy temperatures. Our findings suggest that the coupling of leaf-level photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, common in land surface schemes, may need be re-examined when applied to high-temperature events.},

	abstract = {The scientific rigor and computational methods of causal inference have had great impacts on many disciplines, but have only recently begun to take hold in spatial applications. Spatial casual inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality, and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies, and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate. Code to implement many of the methods using the popular Bayesian software OpenBUGS is provided.},

	abstract = {Research in the past few decades has discussed the concept of "spatial confounding" but has provided conflicting definitions and proposed solutions, some of which do not address the issue of confounding as it is understood in the field of causal inference. We give a clear account of spatial confounding as the existence of an unmeasured confounding variable with a spatial structure. Under certain conditions, including the smoothness of the confounder as a function of space, we show that spatial covariates (e.g., latitude and longitude) can be handled as typical covariates by algorithms popular in causal inference. We focus on "double machine learning" (DML) by which flexible models are fit for both the exposure and outcome variables to arrive at a causal estimator with favorable convergence properties. These models avoid restrictive assumptions, such as linearity and heterogeneity, which are present in linear models typically employed in spatial statistics and which can lead to strong bias when violated. We demonstrate the advantages of the DML approach analytically and via extensive simulation studies.},

	abstract = {Causal decision making (CDM) based on machine learning has become a routine part of business. Businesses algorithmically target offers, incentives, and recommendations to affect consumer behavior. Recently, we have seen an acceleration of research related to CDM and causal effect estimation (CEE) using machine-learned models. This article highlights an important perspective: CDM is not the same as CEE, and counterintuitively, accurate CEE is not necessary for accurate CDM. Our experience is that this is not well understood by practitioners or most researchers. Technically, the estimand of interest is different, and this has important implications both for modeling and for the use of statistical models for CDM. We draw on prior research to highlight three implications. (1) We should consider carefully the objective function of the causal machine learning, and if possible, optimize for accurate treatment assignment rather than for accurate effect-size estimation. (2) Confounding does not have the same effect on CDM as it does on CEE. The upshot is that for supporting CDM it may be just as good or even better to learn with confounded data as with unconfounded data. Finally, (3) causal statistical modeling may not be necessary to support CDM because a proxy target for statistical modeling might do as well or better. This third observation helps to explain at least one broad common CDM practice that seems wrong at first blush: the widespread use of non-causal models for targeting interventions. The last two implications are particularly important in practice, as acquiring (unconfounded) data on all counterfactuals can be costly and often impracticable. These observations open substantial research ground. We hope to facilitate research in this area by pointing to related articles from multiple contributing fields, including two dozen articles published the last three to four years.},

	abstract = {There is currently much debate about the effectiveness of foreign aid and about what kind of projects can engender economic development. There is skepticism about the ability of econometric analysis to resolve these issues or of development agencies to learn from their own experience. In response, there is increasing use in development economics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to accumulate credible knowledge of what works, without overreliance on questionable theory or statistical methods. When RCTs are not possible, the proponents of these methods advocate quasi-randomization through instrumental variable (IV) techniques or natural experiments. I argue that many of these applications are unlikely to recover quantities that are useful for policy or understanding: two key issues are the misunderstanding of exogeneity and the handling of heterogeneity. I illustrate from the literature on aid and growth. Actual randomization faces similar problems as does quasi-randomization, notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary. I argue that experiments have no special ability to produce more credible knowledge than other methods, and that actual experiments are frequently subject to practical problems that undermine any claims to statistical or epistemic superiority. I illustrate using prominent experiments in development and elsewhere. As with IV methods, RCT-based evaluation of projects, without guidance from an understanding of underlying mechanisms, is unlikely to lead to scientific progress in the understanding of economic development. I welcome recent trends in development experimentation away from the evaluation of projects and toward the evaluation of theoretical mechanisms. (JEL C21, F35, O19)},

	abstract = {Arctic amplification has been attributed predominantly to a positive lapse rate feedback in winter, when boundary-layer temperature inversions focus warming near the surface. Predicting high-latitude climate change effectively thus requires identifying the local and remote physical processes that set the Arctic’s vertical warming structure. In this study, we analyze output from the CESM Large Ensemble's 21st century climate change projection to diagnose the relative influence of two Arctic heating sources, local sea-ice loss and remote changes in atmospheric heat transport. Causal effects are quantified with a statistical inference method, allowing us to assess the energetic pathways mediating the Arctic temperature response and the role of internal variability across the ensemble. We find that a step-increase in latent heat flux convergence causes Arctic lower-tropospheric warming in all seasons, while additionally reducing net longwave cooling at the surface. However, these effects only lead to small and short-lived changes in boundary layer inversion strength. By contrast, a step-decrease in sea-ice extent in the melt season causes, in fall and winter, surface-amplified warming and weakened boundary-layer temperature inversions. Sea-ice loss also enhances surface turbulent heat fluxes and cloud-driven condensational heating, which mediate the atmospheric temperature response. While the aggregate effect of many moist transport events and seasons of sea-ice loss will be different than the response to hypothetical perturbations, our results nonetheless highlight the mechanisms that alter the Arctic temperature inversion in response to CO2 forcing. As sea ice declines, the atmosphere’s boundary-layer temperature structure is weakened, static stability decreases, and a thermodynamic coupling emerges between the Arctic surface and the overlying troposphere.},

These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30–46\% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63–82\% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

A comprehensive understanding of how the relationship between landscape patterns (composition and configuration) and NPP changes across scales, is helpful for landscape planning and ecological protection and restoration. However, relevant research is currently understudied. Therefore, this study selected 39 landscape metrics and 5 types of land use in the Shule River Basin (SRB), and analysed their correlation under eight different scales via multiple linear regression models, aiming to determine the core landscape metrics to assess the NPP. Results indicate obvious spatial variations in the landscape metrics. At the same time, NPP in SRB was relatively small and showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. Landscape metrics and NPP showed different degrees of positive or negative correlation at different grid scales, and there were higher correlation at the 30 km scale. The increase in patch fragmentation and diversity promoted an increase in NPP. The correlation between landscape metrics and NPP was higher and more significant at the class level than at the landscape level, except in the case of unused land. Configuration metric (patch density and patch richness) explained 68\% of the variation in NPP at the landscape level. At the class level, composition metrics (class area and percentage of landscape) played an important role in farmland, forestland, and grassland, while edge density (configuration metric) played an absolute role in the built-up land and unused land; overall, the effectiveness of the model was stronger at the class level than at the landscape level. The generated regression model allows us to quantitatively understand how to characterize changes in NPP through changes in landscape patterns. Appropriate landscape pattern and optimal scale should be considered in landscape planning and land use management to reduce the expected ecological impact.},

We find little evidence of heterogeneous responses to purely technical information or to traditional conservation messages that combine technical information and moral suasion. In contrast, norm-based messages that combine technical information, moral suasion and social comparisons exhibit strong heterogeneity: households that are wealthier, owner-occupied and use more water are more responsive. These subgroups tend to be least responsive to pecuniary incentives. We find no evidence that any subgroup increases their water use in response to the messages. By targeting the messages to subgroups known to be most responsive, program costs could be reduced by over 50\% with only a 20\% reduction in the treatment effect.

It evaluates further the sensitivity of croplands to any possible changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Location The location is global, geographically explicit. Methods The methods used are spatial data synthesis and analysis and numerical modelling. Results There is a cropland ‘reserve’ of 120\%, mainly in tropical South America and Africa. Our climate sensitivity analysis indicates that the southern provinces of Canada, north-western and north-central states of the United States, northern Europe, southern Former Soviet Union and the Manchurian plains of China are most sensitive to changes in temperature. The Great Plains region of the United States and north-eastern China are most sensitive to changes in precipitation. The regions that are sensitive to precipitation change are also sensitive to changes in CO2, but the magnitude is small compared to the influence of direct climate change. We estimate that climate change, as simulated by global climate models, will expand cropland suitability by an additional 16\%, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. However, the tropics (mainly Africa, northern South America, Mexico and Central America and Oceania) will experience a small decrease in suitability due to climate change. Main conclusions There is a large reserve of cultivable croplands, mainly in tropical South America and Africa. However, much of this land is under valuable forests or in protected areas. Furthermore, the tropical soils could potentially lose fertility very rapidly once the forest cover is removed. Regions that lie at the margins of temperature or precipitation limitation to cultivation are most sensitive to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration. It is anticipated that climate change will result in an increase in cropland suitability in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes (mainly in developed nations), while the tropics will lose suitability (mainly in developing nations).},

This has proven difficult because the putative causes (e.g., environment, species identity, biodiversity, and functional traits) are numerous and correlated. The problem is exacerbated by a lack of a formal framework for unambiguously relating theoretical language to precise, quantitative expressions of that language. Using a formal framework for the graphical expression of complex causal hypotheses, we developed a causal diagram of the concepts required to comprehensively test whether hypothesized sets of functional traits mediate the relationship between community structure and ecosystem function. We then used causal analysis, simulations, and field data to develop and test analytical strategies for understanding how community structure influences ecosystem functions via functional traits. Formal causal analysis showed that biodiversity–ecosystem function correlations are noncausal associations. Using simulations, we showed how biodiversity correlations and species identity effects can arise from misspecification or incomplete mediation by functional trait composites. We also found that different types of model misspecification result in different patterns of residuals, which may be used to diagnose gaps in functional trait hypotheses. Treating the model misspecifications eliminated associations between species identity or biodiversity and ecosystem function. Finally, we provide an example of the analysis of field data to demonstrate how to use these insights to conduct a research program that has the goal of understanding the mechanistic trait relationships that link community structure to ecosystem function.},

These cold spells were linked to a meandering upper-tropospheric jet stream pattern and a negative Arctic Oscillation index (AO). However, the nature of the drivers behind these circulation patterns remains controversial. Various studies have proposed different mechanisms related to changes in the Arctic, most of them related to a reduction in sea ice concentrations or increasing Eurasian snow cover.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Here, a novel type of time series analysis, called causal effect networks (CEN), based on graphical models is introduced to assess causal relationships and their time delays between different processes. The effect of different Arctic actors on winter circulation on weekly to monthly time scales is studied, and robust network patterns are found. Barents and Kara sea ice concentrations are detected to be important external drivers of the midlatitude circulation, influencing winter AO via tropospheric mechanisms and through processes involving the stratosphere. Eurasia snow cover is also detected to have a causal effect on sea level pressure in Asia, but its exact role on AO remains unclear. The CEN approach presented in this study overcomes some difficulties in interpreting correlation analyses, complements model experiments for testing hypotheses involving teleconnections, and can be used to assess their validity. The findings confirm that sea ice concentrations in autumn in the Barents and Kara Seas are an important driver of winter circulation in the midlatitudes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Analysis of trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services (ES) and their underlying drivers is a main issue in ES research. The analysis is complex and requires innovative analytical approaches. To address this complexity, we used an original approach that combines a multivariate regression tree (MRT), data analysis, and spatial mapping. We applied this approach to the main cropping region in France (mainly the Paris basin of production) using an existing dataset (i.e. soil, climate, crop sequences and management) from the French National Ecosystem Assessment to determine relationships between agricultural production, two services to farmers – nitrogen provision to crops and water provision to crops – and three services to society – blue water provision, water quality regulation, and climate regulation. To support land managers and decision-makers, we also analyzed the extent to which manageable soil properties and agricultural practices (crop rotation and management) are major drivers of trade-offs or synergies. We demonstrated that water quality regulation, nitrogen provision to crops, and climate regulation have synergistic relationships in production situations in the northeastern region of the study area due to the types of crop rotation, frequency of cover crops in the crop rotation, the soil pH, and the soil available water capacity. We also identified that cover crops, while promoting these three ES, can drive a trade-off between two key water-related services: water provision to crops and blue water provision (i.e. between a service to farmers and one to society). By capturing non-linear relationships and threshold effects, our MRT-based approach overcomes the main limitations of classic statistical approaches. The approach is also spatially explicit and simple and intuitive to interpret, especially for non-scientists; our results thus provide researchers and ecosystem managers (e.g. agricultural policy makers) with key information to design ecosystem management strategies that promote a balanced bundle of ES.},

Socioeconomic and environmental factors are among the most important factors driving the creation of diverse landscapes, with a high supply of ecosystem services (ES). However, these factors, along with climate change, could also have irreversible consequences on local ecosystems. Thus, this study aimed to reveal the importance of socio-ecological factors in shaping ES bundles to manage natural resources efficiently and enhance human well-being. Using the Ionian Islands as a case study, we explored the relationships among multiple ES, including their supply and demand indicators. We identified bundles of ES to distinguish regions in which supply and demand exhibit different characteristics. An ensemble machine learning method (Random Forest - RF) was used to identify the most important socio-ecological variables out of 17 tested that contribute to ES bundles. Our results produced five bundles of ES supply and six bundles of ES demand. The most important variables for the distribution of ES supply bundles were landscape heterogeneity, elevation, slope, landscape connectivity, and population. In comparison, variables representing elevation, slope, and population were among the most important variables contributing to ES demand bundles. RF exhibited both good classification and predictability, which was supported by the accuracy measures. Our findings demonstrated that research on ES should account for underlying socio-ecological drivers that influence the supply and demand of ES to improve our understanding of the possible impacts of future management decisions regarding the diverse Mediterranean landscapes of the Ionian Islands.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) have become a key concept in the assessment of natural resources, as a way to connect human well-being and ecosystems degradation. However, ES quantification is considered a basic problem because provision varies considerably as a result of land use change and site-specific characteristics (i.e. climate, soil, topography, and time). Thus, more detailed studies are needed to assess whether these changes affect ecological variables. We explored the use of environmental and crop management variables in predicting the provision of four ES (soil C balance, soil N balance, N2O emission control and groundwater contamination control) in three agroecosystems located in the Pampa region (Argentina). Data-mining, represented by k-means cluster and classification trees, was used to identify the dependence of ES provision on the variation of both environmental and crop management factors. We used plot level crop management and environmental field information stored in a large database during a 10-year period. The k-means method selected five different clusters. The final configuration showed two contrasting clusters: one with the lowest ES provision, and another one with the highest ES provision. The five clusters were represented in the terminal nodes of the final classification tree. Regarding the predictive power of the variables, crop and year were the most important predictors. Then, differences observed in ES provision resulted from changes in land use (variable “crop”) and crop season (variable “year”). These results are meant to enlighten stakeholders in terms of how to manage Pampean agroecosystems in order to positively influence ES provision.},

However, the Landsat spatial resolution (30 m) has often been considered too coarse for reliably mapping small-scale selective logging. Imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-2 sensor, with a resampled 10 m spatial resolution, may improve the detection of forest disturbances. This study compared the performance of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for the detection of selective logging in an area located in the Brazilian Amazon. Logging impacts in seven areas, which had governmental authorization for harvesting timber, were mapped by calculating the difference of a self-referenced normalized burn ratio (\&Delta;rNBR) index over corresponding time periods (2016\&ndash;2017) for imagery of both satellite sensors. A robust reference dataset was built using both high- and very-high-resolution imagery. It was used to define optimum \&Delta;rNBR thresholds for forest disturbance maps, via a bootstrapping procedure, and for estimating accuracies and areas. A further assessment of our approach was also performed in three unlogged areas. Additionally, field data regarding logging infrastructure were collected in the seven study sites where logging occurred. Both satellites showed the same performance in terms of accuracy, with area-adjusted overall accuracies of 96.7\% and 95.7\% for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8, respectively. However, Landsat 8 mapped 36.9\% more area of selective logging compared to Sentinel-2 data. Logging infrastructure was better detected from Sentinel-2 (43.2\%) than Landsat 8 (35.5\%) data, confirming its potential for mapping small-scale logging. We assessed the impacted area by selective logging with a regular 300 m \&times; 300 m grid over the pixel-based results, leading to 1143 ha and 1197 ha of disturbed forest on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, respectively. No substantial differences in terms of accuracy were found by adding three unlogged areas to the original seven study sites.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important variable in ecological, hydrological, and meteorological studies. An effective method for improving the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval is the mutual supplementation of multi-source data. The sensor configuration and band settings of different optical sensors lead to differences in band reflectivity in the inter-data, further resulting in the differences between vegetation indices. The combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with multi-source optical data has been widely used for soil moisture retrieval. However, the influence of vegetation indices derived from different sources of optical data on retrieval accuracy has not been comparatively analyzed thus far. Therefore, the suitability of vegetation parameters derived from different sources of optical data for accurate soil moisture retrieval requires further investigation. In this study, vegetation indices derived from GF-1, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 were compared. Based on Sentinel-1 SAR and three optical data, combined with the water cloud model (WCM) and the advanced integral equation model (AIEM), the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval was investigated. The results indicate that, Sentinel-2 data were more sensitive to vegetation characteristics and had a stronger capability for vegetation signal detection. The ranking of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values from the three sensors was as follows: the largest was in Sentinel-2, followed by Landsat-8, and the value of GF-1 was the smallest. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) value of Landsat-8 was larger than that of Sentinel-2. With reference to the relative components in the WCM model, the contribution of vegetation scattering exceeded that of soil scattering within a vegetation index range of approximately 0.55\&ndash;0.6 in NDVI-based models and all ranges in NDWI1-based models. The threshold value of NDWI2 for calculating vegetation water content (VWC) was approximately an NDVI value of 0.4\&ndash;0.55. In the soil moisture retrieval, Sentinel-2 data achieved higher accuracy than data from the other sources and thus was more suitable for the study for combination with SAR in soil moisture retrieval. Furthermore, compared with NDVI, higher accuracy of soil moisture could be retrieved by using NDWI1 (R2 = 0.623, RMSE = 4.73\%). This study provides a reference for the selection of optical data for combination with SAR in soil moisture retrieval.},

	abstract = {Establishing causal relations between random variables from observational data is perhaps the most important challenge in today's science. In remote sensing and geosciences, this is of special relevance to better understand the earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on an observational causal inference, and thus, we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (nondeterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires: 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions and 2) the estimation of statistical independence between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the sensitivity (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence, the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate the performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves the state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, and it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions. The presented approach confirms the validity in observational bivariate problems in the earth sciences.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in the study of causal methods in the Earth sciences. However, most applications have focused on causal discovery, i.e. inferring the causal relationships and causal structure from data. This paper instead examines causality through the lens of causal inference and how expert-defined causal graphs, a fundamental from causal theory, can be used to clarify assumptions, identify tractable problems, and aid interpretation of results and their causality in Earth science research. We apply causal theory to generic graphs of the Earth system to identify where causal inference may be most tractable and useful to address problems in Earth Science, and avoid potentially incorrect conclusions. Specifically, causal inference may be useful when: (1) the effect of interest is only causally affected by the observed portion of the state space; or: (2) the cause of interest can be assumed to be independent of the evolution of the system's state; or: (3) the state space of the system is reconstructable from lagged observations of the system. However, we also highlight through examples how causal graphs can be used to explicitly define and communicate assumptions and hypotheses, and help to structure analyses, even if causal inference is ultimately challenging given the data availability, limitations and uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Landsat 8 is the most recent generation of Landsat satellite missions that provides remote sensing imagery for earth observation. The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, together with Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared sensor (TIRS) represent fundamental tools for earth observation due to the optimal combination of the radiometric and geometric images resolution provided by these sensors. However, there are substantial differences between the information provided by Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. In order to perform a multi-temporal analysis, a cross-comparison between image from different Landsat satellites is required. The present study is based on the evaluation of specific intercalibration functions for the standardization of main vegetation indices calculated from the two Landsat generation images, with respect to main land use types. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index), LSWI (Land Surface Water Index), NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio), VIgreen (Green Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) have been derived from August 2017 ETM+ and OLI images (path: 188; row: 32) for the study area (Basilicata Region, located in the southern part of Italy) selected as a highly representative of Mediterranean environment. Main results show slight differences in the values of average reflectance for each band: OLI shows higher values in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength for all the land use types, while in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) the ETM+ shows higher reflectance values. High correlation coefficients between different indices (in particular NDVI and NDWI) show that ETM+ and OLI can be used as complementary data. The best correlation in terms of cross-comparison was found for NDVI, NDWI, SAVI, and EVI indices; while according to land use classes, statistically significant differences were found for almost all the considered indices calculated with the two sensors.},

	abstract = {Due to technical and budget limitations, remote sensing instruments trade spatial resolution and swath width. As a result not one sensor provides both high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. However, the ability to monitor seasonal landscape changes at ﬁne resolution is urgently needed for global change science. One approach is to “blend” the radiometry from daily, global data (e.g. MODIS, MERIS, SPOTVegetation) with data from high-resolution sensors with less frequent coverage (e.g. Landsat, CBERS, ResourceSat). Unfortunately, existing algorithms for blending multi-source data have some shortcomings, particularly in accurately predicting the surface reﬂectance of heterogeneous landscapes. This study has developed an enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reﬂectance fusion model (ESTARFM) based on the existing STARFM algorithm, and has tested it with both simulated and actual satellite data. Results show that ESTARFM improves the accuracy of predicted ﬁne-resolution reﬂectance, especially for heterogeneous landscapes, and preserves spatial details. Taking the NIR band as an example, for homogeneous regions the prediction of the ESTARFM is slightly better than the STARFM (average absolute difference [AAD] 0.0106 vs. 0.0129 reﬂectance units). But for a complex, heterogeneous landscape, the prediction accuracy of ESTARFM is improved even more compared with STARFM (AAD 0.0135 vs. 0.0194). This improved fusion algorithm will support new investigations into how global landscapes are changing across both seasonal and interannual timescales.},

In the present study, we investigated the impact of spatial resolution of various precipitation datasets on discharge estimates. First, a new precipitation spatial downscaling procedure was developed and applied to four gridded global precipitation datasets based on (i) solely satellite observations: CMORPH and PERSIANN, (ii) satellite and in situ observations: TRMM, and (iii) satellite and in situ observations and reanalysis data: MSWEP. The here presented downscaling methodology blended global precipitation datasets with data on vegetation and topography to improve the representation of precipitation spatial variability. Second, interpolated in situ, non-downscaled (25 km) and downscaled (1 km) precipitation data were used to force a grid-distributed version of the HBV-96 rainfall-runoff model for the Magdalena River basin in Colombia. Results showed that MSWEP and TRMM outperformed CMORPH and PERSIANN precipitation datasets. The downscaling procedure resulted in considerable improvements in coefficient of determination, root mean square error and bias in comparison with in situ precipitation observations. Discharge model estimates were also in better agreement with the observations when the model was forced with the downscaled precipitation. Model performance was improved with Kling Gupta efficiency increases in the order of 0.1 to 0.5. Moreover, better discharge simulations were obtained using downscaled precipitation compared to using only in situ precipitation data when using less than 100 stations.},

	abstract = {Sustaining ecosystem services (ES), mitigating their tradeoffs and avoiding unfavorable future trajectories are pressing social-environmental challenges that require enhanced understanding of their relationships across scales. Current knowledge of ES relationships is often constrained to one spatial scale or one snapshot in time. In this research, we integrated biophysical modeling with future scenarios to examine changes in relationships among eight ES indicators from 2001–2070 across three spatial scales—grid cell, subwatershed, and watershed. We focused on the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin) in the Midwestern United States—an exemplar for many urbanizing agricultural landscapes. Relationships among ES indicators changed over time; some relationships exhibited high interannual variations (e.g. drainage vs. food production, nitrate leaching vs. net ecosystem exchange) and even reversed signs over time (e.g. perennial grass production vs. phosphorus yield). Robust patterns were detected for relationships among some regulating services (e.g. soil retention vs. water quality) across three spatial scales, but other relationships lacked simple scaling rules. This was especially true for relationships of food production vs. water quality, and drainage vs. number of days with runoff {\textgreater}10 mm, which differed substantially across spatial scales. Our results also showed that local tradeoffs between food production and water quality do not necessarily scale up, so reducing local tradeoffs may be insufﬁcient to mitigate such tradeoffs at the watershed scale. We further synthesized these cross-scale patterns into a typology of factors that could drive changes in ES relationships across scales: (1) effects of biophysical connections, (2) effects of dominant drivers, (3) combined effects of biophysical linkages and dominant drivers, and (4) artiﬁcial scale effects, and concluded with management implications. Our study highlights the importance of taking a dynamic perspective and accounting for spatial scales in monitoring and management to sustain future ES.},

We develop a spatially explicit model describing the coupled dynamics of an agricultural landscape and human population size to assess the effect of different land-use management strategies, defined by agricultural clustering and intensification, on the sustainability of the social-ecological system. We show how agricultural expansion can cause natural habitats to undergo a percolation transition leading to abrupt habitat fragmentation that feedbacks on human's decision making, aggravating landscape degradation. We found that agricultural intensification to spare land from conversion is a successful strategy only in highly natural landscapes, and that clustering agricultural land is the most effective measure to preserve large connected natural fragments, prevent severe fragmentation and thus, enhance sustainability.},

	abstract = {Forecasting crop yields is becoming increasingly important under the current context in which food security needs to be ensured despite the challenges brought by climate change, an expanding world population accompanied by rising incomes, increasing soil erosion, and decreasing water resources. Temperature, radiation, water availability and other environmental conditions inﬂuence crop growth, development, and ﬁnal grain yield in a complex nonlinear manner. Machine learning (ML) techniques, and deep learning (DL) methods in particular, can account for such nonlinear relations between yield and its covariates. However, they typically lack transparency and interpretability, since the way the predictions are derived is not directly evident. Yet, in the context of yield forecasting, understanding which are the underlying factors behind both a predicted loss or gain is of great relevance. Here, we explore how to beneﬁt from the increased predictive performance of DL methods while maintaining the ability to interpret how the models achieve their results. To do so, we applied a deep neural network to multivariate time series of vegetation and meteorological data to estimate the wheat yield in the Indian Wheat Belt. Then, we visualized and analyzed the features and yield drivers learned by the model with the use of regression activation maps. The DL model outperformed other tested models (ridge regression and random forest) and facilitated the interpretation of variables and processes that lead to yield variability. The learned features were mostly related to the length of the growing season, and temperature and light conditions during this time. For example, our results showed that high yields in 2012 were associated with low temperatures accompanied by sunny conditions during the growing period. The proposed methodology can be used for other crops and regions in order to facilitate application of DL models in agriculture.},

Spatial causal inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate. Code to implement many of the methods using the popular Bayesian software OpenBUGS is provided.},

Based on field observations from 6,098 forest, shrubland, and grassland sites across China and predictions from an integrative model combining multiple theories, we systematically examined the direct effects of climate, soils, and human impacts on SOC storage versus the indirect effects mediated by species richness (SR), aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), and belowground biomass (BB). We found that favorable climates (high temperature and precipitation) had a consistent negative effect on SOC storage in forests and shrublands, but not in grasslands. Climate favorability, particularly high precipitation, was associated with both higher SR and higher BB, which had consistent positive effects on SOC storage, thus offsetting the direct negative effect of favorable climate on SOC. The indirect effects of climate on SOC storage depended on the relationships of SR with ANPP and BB, which were consistently positive in all biome types. In addition, human disturbance and soil pH had both direct and indirect effects on SOC storage, with the indirect effects mediated by changes in SR, ANPP, and BB. High soil pH had a consistently negative effect on SOC storage. Our findings have important implications for improving global carbon cycling models and ecosystem management: Maintaining high levels of diversity can enhance soil carbon sequestration and help sustain the benefits of plant diversity and productivity.},

The last decade has seen the rapid development of research efforts on the topic of ecosystem services, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This systematic review aims to identify, evaluate and synthesise the evidence provided in published peer reviewed studies framing their work in the context of spatially explicit remote sensing assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. Initially, a search through indexed scientific databases found 5920 papers making direct and/or indirect reference to the topic of “ecosystem services” between the years of 1960 and 2013. Among these papers, 211 make direct reference to the use of remote sensing. During the search we aimed at selecting papers that were peer-reviewed publications available through indexed bibliographic databases. For this reason, our literature search did not include books, grey literature, extended abstracts and presentations. We quantitatively present the growth of remote sensing applications in ecosystem services’ research, reviewing the literature to produce a summary of the state of available and feasible remote sensing variables used in the assessment and valuation of ecosystem services. The results provide valuable information on how remotely sensed Earth observation data are used currently to produce spatially-explicit assessments and valuation of ecosystem services. Using examples from the literature we produce a concise summary of what has been done, what can be done and what can be improved upon in the future to integrate remote sensing into ecosystem services research. The reason for doing so is to motivate discussion about methodological challenges, solutions and to encourage an uptake of remote sensing technology and data where it has potential practical applications.},

Yet, the impacts of increasing the diversity of cultivated crop species or varieties in agroecosystems are still under scrutiny. The available empirical evidence is scattered in scope, agronomic and geographic contexts, and impacts on ecosystem services may depend on the type of diversification strategy used. To robustly assess the effects of crop diversification in agroecosystems, we compiled the results of 95 meta-analyses integrating 5156 experiments conducted over 84 experimental years and representing more than 54,500 paired observations on 120 crop species in 85 countries. Overall, our synthesis of experimental data from across the globe shows that crop diversification enhances not only crop production (median effect +14\%) but also the associated biodiversity (+24\%, i.e., the biodiversity of non-cultivated plants and animals), and several supporting and regulating ecosystem services including water quality (+51\%), pest and disease control (+63\%) and soil quality (+11\%). However, there was substantial variability in the results for each individual ecosystem service between different diversification strategies such as agroforestry, intercropping, cover crops, crop rotation or variety mixtures. Agroforestry is particularly effective in delivering multiple ecosystem services, that is, water regulation and quality, pest and diseases regulation, associated biodiversity, long-term soil productivity and quality. Variety mixtures, instead, provide the lowest benefits, whereas the other strategies show intermediate results. Our results highlight that while increasing the diversity of cultivated crop species or varieties in agroecosystems represents a very promising strategy for more sustainable land management, contributing to enhanced yields, enhanced biodiversity and ecosystem services, some crop diversification strategies are more effective than others in supporting key ecosystem services.},

Considering soil carbon content as a proxy for soil carbon storage, we compare HNVFs with soils that undergo more conventional land management (nHNVFs) and study the consequences of diverse land uses and geographic regions as additional explanatory variables. The results of our research show that, at the European level, organic carbon content is higher in HNVF than in nHNVF. However, this difference is strongly affected by the type of land use and the geographic region. Rather than seeing HNVF and nHNVF as two sharply distinct categories, as for carbon storage potential, we provide indications that the interplay between soil type (HNVF or nHNVF), land use, and geographic region determines carbon content in soils.},

            Food security interventions and policies need reliable estimates of crop production and the scope to enhance production on existing cropland. Here we assess the performance of two widely used ‘top-down’ gridded frameworks (Global Agro-ecological Zones and Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project) versus an alternative ‘bottom-up’ approach (Global Yield Gap Atlas). The Global Yield Gap Atlas estimates extra production potential locally for a number of sites representing major breadbaskets and then upscales the results to larger spatial scales. We find that estimates from top-down frameworks are alarmingly unlikely, with estimated potential production being lower than current farm production at some locations. The consequences of using these coarse estimates to predict food security are illustrated by an example for sub-Saharan Africa, where using different approaches would lead to different prognoses about future cereal self-sufficiency. Our study shows that foresight about food security and associated agriculture research priority setting based on yield potential and yield gaps derived from top-down approaches are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and would benefit from incorporating estimates from bottom-up approaches.},

The important issue of computational efficiency will also be addressed. These developments are illustrated in the field of geosciences and remote sensing at local and global scales through a set of illustrative examples. In particular, important problems for land, ocean, and atmosphere monitoring are considered, from accurately estimating oceanic chlorophyll content and pigments to retrieving vegetation properties from multi- and hyperspectral sensors as well as estimating atmospheric parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture, and ozone) from infrared sounders.},

The approach estimates a matrix that well-approximates the original (incomplete) matrix, but has lower complexity according to the nuclear norm for matrices. From a technical perspective, we generalize results from the matrix completion literature by allowing the patterns of missing data to have a time series dependency structure.

	abstract = {Wildfires have become one of the biggest natural hazards for environments worldwide. The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the magnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region, climate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by these events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and prediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series analysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to medium to large wildfires ({\textgreater} 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span of two decades (1996–2016). The method's ability for estimating counterfactual vegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify abrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting vegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions to assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its predictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire periods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from R2 = 0.66 to R2 = 0.93 in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from R2 = 0.48 to R2 = 0.81 for Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and from R2 = 0.49 to R2 = 0.85 for Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show greater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as having a lower Burning Index. We find that on average, wildfires cause a 25\% initial decrease in the vegetation index (NDVI) and a larger than 80\% drop in wetness indices (NBR and NDMI) after they occur. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects on vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases never return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period. We also find that the dynamical effects vary across regions and have an impact on seasonal cycles of vegetation in later years. Lastly, we discuss the usefulness of using GSC in remote sensing analyses.},

In this paper, we propose a method that not only relaxes this often-violated assumption, but also unifies the synthetic control method (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010) with linear fixed effects models under a simple framework, of which DID is a special case. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method has several advantages. First, it allows the treatment to be correlated with unobserved unit and time heterogeneities under reasonable modeling assumptions. Second, it generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. Third, with a built-in cross-validation procedure, it avoids specification searches and thus is easy to implement.

	abstract = {Wheat production plays an important role in Morocco. Current wheat forecast systems use weather and vegetation data during the crop growing phase, thus limiting the earliest possible release date to early spring. However, Morocco's wheat production is mostly rainfed and thus strongly tied to fluctuations in rainfall, which in turn depend on slowly evolving climate dynamics. This offers a source of predictability at longer time scales. Using physically guided causal discovery algorithms, we extract climate precursors for wheat yield variability from gridded fields of geopotential height and sea surface temperatures which show potential for accurate yield forecasts already in December, with around 50\% explained variance in an out-of-sample cross validation. The detected interactions are physically meaningful and consistent with documented ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. Reliable yield forecasts at such long lead times could provide farmers and policy makers with necessary information for early action and strategic adaptation measurements to support food security.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing technologies have a high potential in applications for evaluating land conditions and can facilitate optimized planning for agricultural sectors. However, misinformed land selection decisions limit crop yields and increase production-related costs to farmers. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a land suitability assessment system using satellite remote sensing-derived soil-vegetation indicators. A multicriteria decision analysis was conducted by integrating weighted linear combinations and fuzzy multicriteria analyses in a GIS platform for suitability assessment using the following eight criteria: elevation, slope, and LST vegetation indices (SAVI, ARVI, SARVI, MSAVI, and OSAVI). The relative priorities of the indicators were identified using a fuzzy expert system. Furthermore, the results of the land suitability assessment were evaluated by ground truthed yield data. In addition, a yield estimation method was developed using indices representing influential factors. The analysis utilizing equal weights showed that 43\% of the land (1832 km2) was highly suitable, 41\% of the land (1747 km2) was moderately suitable, and 10\% of the land (426 km2) was marginally suitable for improved yield productions. Alternatively, expert knowledge was also considered, along with references, when using the fuzzy membership function; as a result, 48\% of the land (2045 km2) was identified as being highly suitable; 39\% of the land (2045 km2) was identified as being moderately suitable, and 7\% of the land (298 km2) was identified as being marginally suitable. Additionally, 6\% (256 km2) of the land was described as not suitable by both methods. Moreover, the yield estimation using SAVI (R2 = 77.3\%), ARVI (R2 = 68.9\%), SARVI (R2 = 71.1\%), MSAVI (R2 = 74.5\%) and OSAVI (R2 = 81.2\%) showed a good predictive ability. Furthermore, the combined model using these five indices reported the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.839); this model was then applied to develop yield prediction maps for the corresponding years (2017–2020). This research suggests that satellite remote sensing methods in GIS platforms are an effective and convenient way for agricultural land-use planners and land policy makers to select suitable cultivable land areas with potential for increased agricultural production.},

However, as advocated in this article, commonly used statistical methods are often too simplistic to represent complex climate–vegetation relationships due to linearity assumptions. Therefore, as an extension of linear Granger-causality analysis, we present a novel non-linear framework consisting of several components, such as data collection from various databases, time series decomposition techniques, feature construction methods, and predictive modelling by means of random forests. Experimental results on global data sets indicate that, with this framework, it is possible to detect non-linear patterns that are much less visible with traditional Granger-causality methods. In addition, we discuss extensive experimental results that highlight the importance of considering non-linear aspects of climate–vegetation dynamics.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The dynamics of biochemical processes in terrestrial ecosystems are tightly coupled to local meteorological conditions. Understanding these interactions is an essential prerequisite for predicting, e.g. the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change. However, many empirical studies in this field rely on correlative approaches and only very few studies apply causal discovery methods.
Here we explore the potential for a recently proposed causal graph discovery algorithm to reconstruct the causal dependency structure underlying biosphere–atmosphere interactions. Using artificial time series with known dependencies that mimic real-world biosphere–atmosphere interactions we address the influence of non-stationarities, i.e. periodicity and heteroscedasticity, on the estimation of causal networks.
We then investigate the interpretability of the method in two case studies. Firstly, we analyse three replicated eddy covariance datasets from a Mediterranean ecosystem. Secondly, we explore global Normalised Difference Vegetation Index time series (GIMMS 3g), along with gridded climate data to study large-scale climatic drivers of vegetation greenness.
We compare the retrieved causal graphs to simple cross-correlation-based approaches to test whether causal graphs are considerably more informative. Overall, the results confirm the capacity of the causal discovery method to extract time-lagged linear dependencies under realistic settings. For example, we find a complete decoupling of the net ecosystem exchange from meteorological variability during summer in the Mediterranean ecosystem. However, cautious interpretations are needed, as the violation of the method's assumptions due to non-stationarities increases the likelihood to detect false links. Overall, estimating directed biosphere–atmosphere networks helps unravel complex multidirectional process interactions. Other than classical correlative approaches, our findings are constrained to a few meaningful sets of relations, which can be powerful insights for the evaluation of terrestrial ecosystem models.},

	abstract = {We study relations between monthly series of vegetation dynamics (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index—NDVI) and soil moisture in regions of tropical South America including Colombia (CO), Venezuela (VE), and Central (CA), South (SA), East (EA) and West (WA) Amazonia, from 2010 to 2018. NDVI data comes from NOAA's Advanced High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), while soil moisture data come from the Soil Moisture/Ocean Salinity satellite mission (SMOS). We use lagged cross-correlations (Pearson test), cross wavelet analysis (wavelet cross spectrum and wavelet coherence), and a nonlinear causality method, PCMCI, that allows identifying common causal drivers and links among high dimensional simultaneous and time-lagged variables. Results for cross-correlations show that when SMOS leads NDVI (negative lags), greater positive correlations are observed in SA, EA and for an area on the right side of the Andes between the CO and VE regions, for negative lags (3-4 months). For lags between 0 and -2 months, cross-correlation in the CO and VE regions are accentuated. Similarly, when NDVI leads SMOS (positive lags), the greatest negative correlations are observed in the SA, EA and the zone between the CO and VE regions. Results of cross wavelet analysis show very different behavior across regions: in CO, VE and CA both variables exhibit a strong positive locking (in phase) at the 12-month frequency band (annual cycle), whereas in WA, EA and SA both variables exhibit a strong negative locking (out phase) (Fig 1). Results of nonlinear causality metrics show significant differences among regions. For instance, from NDVI to SMOS, negative nonlinear causalities (NC) are evident in CO, VE, and CA (at different time lags), whereas positive ones appear in WA, SA, and EA. On the other hand, from SMOS to NDVI, positive NCs appear in CO, VE, WA, and EA, whereas negative NCs appear in CA and SA (Fig 2). Our results confirm the existence of strong two-way feedbacks between SMOS and NDVI in tropical South America, which evidences the fundamental role of the land surface-vegetation interaction in the continent.},

In addition, our method can handle heterogeneous, real-world, mixed-type data with missing values, allowing for both continuous and discrete treatment decisions. Moreover, the design principle of our method can generalize beyond DECI, providing a general End-to-end Causal Inference (ECI) recipe, which enables different ECI frameworks to be built using existing methods.

            Land, atmosphere and climate interact constantly and at different spatial and temporal scales. In this paper we rely on causal discovery methods to infer spatial patterns of causal relations between several key variables of the carbon and water cycles: gross primary productivity, latent heat energy flux for evaporation, surface air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture and radiation. We introduce a methodology based on the convergent cross-mapping (CCM) technique. Despite its good performance in general, CCM is sensitive to (even moderate) noise levels and hyper-parameter selection. We present a robust CCM (RCCM) that relies on temporal bootstrapping decision scores and the derivation of more stringent cross-map skill scores. The RCCM method is combined with the information-geometric causal inference (IGCI) method to address the problem of strong and instantaneous variable coupling, another important and long-standing issue of CCM. The proposed methodology allows to derive spatially explicit global maps of causal relations between the involved variables and retrieve the underlying complexity of the interactions. Results are generally consistent with reported patterns and process understanding, and constitute a new way to quantify and understand carbon and water fluxes interactions.},

To this end, we propose a framework for generating and evaluating a diverse set of counterfactual explanations based on determinantal point processes. To evaluate the actionability of counterfactuals, we provide metrics that enable comparison of counterfactual-based methods to other local explanation methods. We further address necessary tradeoffs and point to causal implications in optimizing for counterfactuals. Our experiments on four real-world datasets show that our framework can generate a set of counterfactuals that are diverse and well approximate local decision boundaries, outperforming prior approaches to generating diverse counterfactuals.

	abstract = {With climate change threatening agricultural productivity and global food demand increasing, it is important to better understand which farm management practices will maximize crop yields in various climatic conditions. To assess the effectiveness of agricultural practices, researchers often turn to randomized field experiments, which are reliable for identifying causal effects but are often limited in scope and therefore lack external validity. Recently, researchers have also leveraged large observational datasets from satellites and other sources, which can lead to conclusions biased by confounding variables or systematic measurement errors. Because experimental and observational datasets have complementary strengths, in this paper we propose a method that uses a combination of experimental and observational data in the same analysis. As a case study, we focus on the causal effect of crop rotation on corn (maize) and soy yields in the Midwestern United States. We find that, in terms of root mean squared error, our hybrid method performs 13\% better than using experimental data alone and 26\% better than using the observational data alone in the task of predicting the effect of rotation on corn yield at held-out experimental sites. Further, the causal estimates based on our method suggest that benefits of crop rotations on corn yield are lower in years and locations with high temperatures whereas the benefits of crop rotations on soy yield are higher in years and locations with high temperatures. In particular, we estimated that the benefit of rotation on corn yields (and soy yields) was 0.84 t/ha (0.23 t/ha) on average for the top quintile of temperatures, 1.02 t/ha (0.20 t/ha) on average for the whole dataset, and 1.18 t/ha (0.15 t/ha) on average for the bottom quintile of temperatures.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this review article is to demonstrate how the quasi-experimental approach has been used to study environmental and natural resource issues related to agricultural production. Design/methodology/approach This review article first provides a short introduction to the quasi-experimental approach using the potential outcomes framework and then uses studies on the environmental sustainability of agricultural production to illustrate how quasi-experimental methods have been applied. Papers reviewed consist of studies that estimate the environmental externalities from agricultural production, evaluate agri-environmental and other related policies and programs, and demonstrate issues related to on-farm resource use and climate adaptation. Findings Difference-in-differences (DID) and two-way fixed effects methods that utilize the spatial and temporal variation in panel data are widely used to estimate the causal impact of changes in agricultural production and policy on the environment. Utilizing the discontinuities and limits created by agricultural policies and regulations, local treatment effects on land and other input use are estimated using regression discontinuity (RD) or instrumental variable (IV) methods with cross-sectional data. Originality/value Challenges faced by the food systems have made agricultural sustainability more critical than ever. Over the past three decades, the quasi-experimental approach has become the powerhouse of applied economic research. This review article focuses on quasi-experimental studies on the environmental sustainability of agriculture to provide methodological insights and to highlight gaps in the economics literature of agricultural sustainability.},

	abstract = {Bipartite experiments are a recent object of study in causal inference, whereby treatment is applied to one set of units and outcomes of interest are measured on a different set of units. These experiments are particularly useful in settings where strong interference effects occur between units of a bipartite graph. In market experiments for example, assigning treatment at the seller-level and measuring outcomes at the buyer-level (or vice-versa) may lead to causal models that better account for the interference that naturally occurs between buyers and sellers. While bipartite experiments have been shown to improve the estimation of causal effects in certain settings, the analysis must be done carefully so as to not introduce unnecessary bias. We leverage the generalized propensity score literature to show that we can obtain unbiased estimates of causal effects for bipartite experiments under a standard set of assumptions. We also discuss the construction of confidence sets with proper coverage probabilities. We evaluate these methods using a bipartite graph from a publicly available dataset studied in previous work on bipartite experiments, showing through simulations a significant bias reduction and improved coverage.},

This review summarizes commonly applied designs and quality indicators of RCTs to provide guidance in interpreting and critically evaluating clinical research data.

We performed a review of educational material, review articles, methodological studies, and published clinical trials using the databases MEDLINE, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most relevant recommendations regarding design, conduction, and reporting of RCTs may include the following: 1) clinically relevant end points should be defined a priori, and an unbiased analysis and report of the study results should be warranted, 2) both significant and nonsignificant results should be objectively reported and published, 3) structured study design and performance as indicated in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement should be employed as well as registration in a public trial database, 4) potential conflicts of interest and funding sources should be disclaimed in study report or publication, and 5) in the comparison of experimental treatment with standard care, preplanned interim analyses during an ongoing RCT can aid in maintaining clinical equipoise by assessing benefit, harm, or futility, thus allowing decision on continuation or termination of the trial.},

However, the amount, location and degree of suitability of the basin for agriculture seem not well studied and/or documented. From global data sources, literature review and ﬁeld investigation, a number of agricultural land suitability evaluation criteria were identiﬁed. These criteria were preprocessed as raster layers on a GIS platform and weights of criteria raster layers in determining suitability were computed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). A weighted overlay analysis method was used to compute categories of highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable and unsuitable lands for agriculture in the basin. It was found out that 53.8 \% of the basin’s land coverage was highly suitable for agriculture and 23.2 \% was moderately suitable. The marginally suitable and the unsuitable lands were at 11 and 12 \% respectively. From the analysis, regions of the basin with high suitability as well as those with higher susceptibility for land degradation and soil erosion were identiﬁed.},

The model consistently performs better than the standard GP and the more advanced heteroscedastic GP model, both in terms of accuracy and more sensible confidence intervals.},

The core element of the framework is the derivation of a composite agricultural performance index which is composed of different subindicators taking into account cropping intensity, crop diversity, crop rotations, fallow land frequency, land utilization, water use efficiency, and water availability. We derive these subindicators from net primary productivity and evapotranspiration data obtained from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra satellite during the observation period from 2000 to 2016, as well as from cropland maps created through multiannual classification of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We classified pixel-based NDVI time series covering more than 8 × 106 ha of irrigated cropland based on a hierarchical approach concatenating unsupervised and supervised classification techniques to automatically generate and refine training labels, which are then used to train a decision fusion classifier, achieving an average overall accuracy of 78\%. The results give unprecedented insights into spatial patterns of agricultural performance in the ASB. The proposed method is transferable and applicable for global-scale mapping, and the results of this remote sensing-aided assessment can provide important information for regional agricultural planning purposes.},

            No tillage (NT) is often presented as a means to grow crops with positive environmental externalities, such as enhanced carbon sequestration, improved soil quality, reduced soil erosion, and increased biodiversity. However, whether NT systems are as productive as those relying on conventional tillage (CT) is a controversial issue, fraught by a high variability over time and space. Here, we expand existing datasets to include the results of the most recent field experiments, and we produce a global dataset comparing the crop yields obtained under CT and NT systems. In addition to crop yield, our dataset also reports information on crop growing season, management practices, soil characteristics and key climate parameters throughout the experimental year. The final dataset contains 4403 paired yield observations between 1980 and 2017 for eight major staple crops in 50 countries. This dataset can help to gain insight into the main drivers explaining the variability of the productivity of NT and the consequence of its adoption on crop yields.},

This overview provides a comprehensive analysis of LAI field measurements and remote sensing estimation methods, the product validation methods and product uncertainties, and the application of LAI in global studies. First, the paper clarifies some definitions related to LAI and introduces methods to determine LAI from field measurements and remote sensing observations. After introducing some major global LAI products, progresses made in temporal compositing and prospects for future LAI estimation are analyzed. Subsequently, the overview discusses various LAI product validation schemes, uncertainties in global moderate resolution LAI products, and high resolution reference data. Finally, applications of LAI in global vegetation change, land surface modeling, and agricultural studies are presented. It is recommended that (1) continued efforts are taken to advance LAI estimation algorithms and provide high temporal and spatial resolution products from current and forthcoming missions; (2) further validation studies be conducted to address the inadequacy of current validation studies, especially for underrepresented regions and seasons; and (3) new research frontiers, such as machine learning algorithms, light detection and ranging technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles be pursued to broaden the production and application of LAI. ©2019.

This study aimed to evaluate how climate, soil, and farming practices could affect crop yield under RT, especially under different sources of fertilisation [mineral (M), mineral + organic (MO), and organic (O)]. Multilevel meta-analysis was adopted. The analysis was performed taking into consideration environmental conditions, soil properties, crop rotation, and crop species. Only studies that reported the interaction effect of soil tillage and nutrients management on grain yield were included. The results suggest that the impact of soil tillage and fertilisation sources on crop yield depended on crop species. Using reduced tillage practices, adopting only organic nutrient sources could produce enough grains for legume crops. However, combining both inorganic and organic fertilizers added benefits for cereal crops in terms of grain yield production. This study highlights how conservation tillage practices could be affected by environmental and agronomic factors.},

	abstract = {Many algorithms have been developed for the remote estimation of biophysical characteristics of vegetation, in terms of combinations of spectral bands, derivatives of reﬂectance spectra, neural networks, inversion of radiative transfer models, and several multi-spectral statistical approaches. However, the most widespread type of algorithm used is the mathematical combination of visible and near-infrared reﬂectance bands, in the form of spectral vegetation indices. Applications of such vegetation indices have ranged from leaves to the entire globe, but in many instances, their applicability is speciﬁc to species, vegetation types or local conditions. The general objective of this study is to evaluate different vegetation indices for the remote estimation of the green leaf area index (Green LAI) of two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. Among the indices tested, the chlorophyll Indices (the CIGreen, the CIRed-edge and the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index, MTCI) exhibited strong and signiﬁcant linear relationships with Green LAI, and thus were sensitive across the entire range of Green LAI evaluated (i.e., 0.0 to more than 6.0 m2/m2). However, the CIRed-edge was the only index insensitive to crop type and produced the most accurate estimations of Green LAI in both crops (RMSE = 0.577 m2/m2). These results were obtained using data acquired with close range sensors (i.e., ﬁeld spectroradiometers mounted 6 m above the canopy) and an aircraft-mounted hyperspectral imaging spectroradiometer (AISA). As the CIRed-edge also exhibited low sensitivity to soil background effects, it constitutes a simple, yet robust tool for the remote and synoptic estimation of Green LAI. Algorithms based on this index may not require re-parameterization when applied to crops with different canopy architectures and leaf structures, but further studies are required for assessing its applicability in other vegetation types (e.g., forests, grasslands).},

Although long yield time series are available in Europe, few studies have been conducted to analyze them in order to investigate the impact of adverse climate events on yield shocks under current and future climate conditions. Here we designated the lowest 10th percentile of the relative yield anomaly as yield shock and analyzed subnational wheat yield shocks across Europe during the last four decades. We applied a data-driven attribution framework to quantify primary climate drivers of wheat yield shock probability based on machine learning and game theory, and used this framework to infer the most critical climate variables that will contribute to yield shocks in the future, under two climate change scenarios. During the period 1980–2018, our attribution analysis showed that 32\% of the observed wheat yield shocks were primarily driven by water limitation, making it the leading climate driver. Projection to future climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 suggested an increased risk of yield shock and a paradigm shift from water limitation dominated yield shock to extreme warming induced shocks over 2070–2099: 46\% and 54\% of areas were primarily driven by extreme warming under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. A similar analysis conducted on yields simulated by an ensemble of crop models showed that models can capture the negative impact of low water supply but missed the impact of excess water. These discrepancies between observed and simulated yield data call for improvement in crop models.},

The proposed methodology combines synergistic information on canopy greenness, biomass, soil, and plant water content from optical and microwave sensors with the atmospheric variables typically measured at meteorological stations. A composite covariance is used in the GP model to account for varying scales, nonstationary, and nonlinear processes. The GP model reports noticeable gains in terms of accuracy with respect to other machine learning approaches for the estimation of corn, wheat, and soybean yields consistently for four years of data across continental U.S. (CONUS). Sparse GPs allow obtaining fast and compact solutions up to a limit, where heavy sparsity compromises the credibility of confidence intervals. We further study the GP interpretability by sensitivity analysis, which reveals that remote sensing parameters accounting for soil moisture and greenness mainly drive the model predictions. GPs finally allow us to identify climate extremes and anomalies impacting crop productivity and their associated drivers.},

              Conservation agriculture (CA) systems are based on minimal soil disturbance, crop residue retention and crop rotation. Although the capacity of rotations to break pest and disease cycles is generally recognized, other benefits of crop rotations in CA systems are seldom acknowledged and little understood. We monitored different conventional and CA cropping systems over the period from 2005 to 2009 in a multi-seasonal trial in Monze, southern Zambia. Both monocropped maize and different maize rotations including cotton and the green manure cover crop sunnhemp (
              Crotalaria juncea
              ) were compared under CA conditions, with the aim of elucidating the effects of crop rotations on soil quality, soil moisture relations and maize productivity. Infiltration, a sensitive indicator of soil quality, was significantly lower on conventionally ploughed plots in all cropping seasons compared to CA plots. Higher water infiltration rate led to greater soil moisture content in CA maize treatments seeded after cotton. Earthworm populations, total carbon and aggregate stability were also significantly higher on CA plots. Improvements in soil quality resulted in higher rainfall use efficiency and higher maize grain yield on CA plots especially those in a two- or three-year rotation. In the 2007/08 and 2008/2009 season, highest yields were obtained from direct-seeded maize after sunnhemp, which yielded 74\% and 136\% more than maize in the conventionally ploughed control treatment with a continuous maize crop. Even in a two-year rotation (maize-cotton), without a legume green manure cover crop, 47\% and 38\% higher maize yields were recorded compared to maize in the conventionally ploughed control in the two years, respectively. This suggests that there are positive effects from crop rotations even in the absence of disease and pest problems. The overall profitability of each system will, however, depend on markets and prices, which will guide the farmer's decision on which, if any, rotation to choose.},

An increase in CCN results in a decrease in the mean cloud droplet size (r\$\_\{e\}\$). The smaller droplet size leads to brighter, more expansive, and longer lasting clouds that reflect more incoming sunlight, thus cooling the earth. Globally, aerosol-cloud interactions cool the Earth, however the strength of the effect is heterogeneous over different meteorological regimes. Understanding how aerosol-cloud interactions evolve as a function of the local environment can help us better understand sources of error in our Earth system models, which currently fail to reproduce the observed relationships. In this work we use recent non-linear, causal machine learning methods to study the heterogeneous effects of aerosols on cloud droplet radius.},

We present a new parametric interval estimator suited for high-dimensional data, that estimates a range of possible CATE values when given a predefined bound on the level of hidden confounding. Further, previous interval estimators do not account for ignorance about the CATE associated with samples that may be underrepresented in the original study, or samples that violate the overlap assumption. Our interval estimator also incorporates model uncertainty so that practitioners can be made aware of out-of-distribution data. We prove that our estimator converges to tight bounds on CATE when there may be unobserved confounding, and assess it using semi-synthetic, high-dimensional datasets.},

We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms—such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks—to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.},

We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without “sparsity” assumptions. We propose an “honest” approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90\% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74\% and 84\% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges between 7–22\%.},

	abstract = {Practitioners in medicine, business, political science, and other fields are increasingly aware that decisions should be personalized to each patient, customer, or voter. A given treatment (e.g. a drug or advertisement) should be administered only to those who will respond most positively, and certainly not to those who will be harmed by it. Individual-level treatment effects can be estimated with tools adapted from machine learning, but different models can yield contradictory estimates. Unlike risk prediction models, however, treatment effect models cannot be easily evaluated against each other using a held-out test set because the true treatment effect itself is never directly observed. Besides outcome prediction accuracy, several metrics that can leverage held-out data to evaluate treatment effects models have been proposed, but they are not widely used. We provide a didactic framework that elucidates the relationships between the different approaches and compare them all using a variety of simulations of both randomized and observational data. Our results show that researchers estimating heterogenous treatment effects need not limit themselves to a single model-fitting algorithm. Instead of relying on a single method, multiple models fit by a diverse set of algorithms should be evaluated against each other using an objective function learned from the validation set. The model minimizing that objective should be used for estimating the individual treatment effect for future individuals.},

In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is ﬂexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be ﬁne-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.},

Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise, ensuring that these changes will be felt for centuries beyond 2100, the current benchmark for projection.

Critical problems for food production and climate-forced human migration are projected to arise well before 2100, raising questions regarding the habitability of some regions of the Earth after the turn of the century. To highlight the need for more distant horizon scanning, we model climate change to 2500 under a suite of emission scenarios and quantify associated projections of crop viability and heat stress. Together, our projections show global climate impacts increase significantly after 2100 without rapid mitigation. As a result, we argue that projections of climate and its effects on human well-being and associated governance and policy must be framed beyond 2100.},

In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference.

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification is one of the main causes for the current biodiversity crisis. While reversing habitat loss on agricultural land is challenging, increasing the farmland configurational heterogeneity (higher field border density) and farmland compositional heterogeneity (higher crop diversity) has been proposed to counteract some habitat loss. Here, we tested whether increased farmland configurational and compositional heterogeneity promote wild pollinators and plant reproduction in 229 landscapes located in four major western European agricultural regions. High-field border density consistently increased wild bee abundance and seed set of radish (
              Raphanus sativus
              ), probably through enhanced connectivity. In particular, we demonstrate the importance of crop–crop borders for pollinator movement as an additional experiment showed higher transfer of a pollen analogue along crop–crop borders than across fields or along semi-natural crop borders. By contrast, high crop diversity reduced bee abundance, probably due to an increase of crop types with particularly intensive management. This highlights the importance of crop identity when higher crop diversity is promoted. Our results show that small-scale agricultural systems can boost pollinators and plant reproduction. Agri-environmental policies should therefore aim to halt and reverse the current trend of increasing field sizes and to reduce the amount of crop types with particularly intensive management.},

	abstract = {One of the central elements of any causal inference is an object called structural causal model (SCM), which represents a collection of mechanisms and exogenous sources of random variation of the system under investigation (Pearl, 2000). An important property of many kinds of neural networks is universal approximability: the ability to approximate any function to arbitrary precision. Given this property, one may be tempted to surmise that a collection of neural nets is capable of learning any SCM by training on data generated by that SCM. In this paper, we show this is not the case by disentangling the notions of expressivity and learnability. Specifically, we show that the causal hierarchy theorem (Thm. 1, Bareinboim et al., 2020), which describes the limits of what can be learned from data, still holds for neural models. For instance, an arbitrarily complex and expressive neural net is unable to predict the effects of interventions given observational data alone. Given this result, we introduce a special type of SCM called a neural causal model (NCM), and formalize a new type of inductive bias to encode structural constraints necessary for performing causal inferences. Building on this new class of models, we focus on solving two canonical tasks found in the literature known as causal identification and estimation. Leveraging the neural toolbox, we develop an algorithm that is both sufficient and necessary to determine whether a causal effect can be learned from data (i.e., causal identifiability); it then estimates the effect whenever identifiability holds (causal estimation). Simulations corroborate the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Extensively managed grasslands are recognized globally for their high biodiversity and their social and cultural values. However, their capacity to deliver multiple ecosystem services (ES) as parts of agricultural systems is surprisingly understudied compared to other production systems. We undertook a comprehensive overview of ES provided by natural and semi-natural grasslands, using southern Africa (SA) and northwest Europe as case studies, respectively. We show that these grasslands can supply additional non-agricultural services, such as water supply and flow regulation, carbon storage, erosion control, climate mitigation, pollination, and cultural ES. While demand for ecosystems services seems to balance supply in natural grasslands of SA, the smaller areas of semi-natural grasslands in Europe appear to not meet the demand for many services. We identified three bundles of related ES from grasslands: water ES including fodder production, cultural ES connected to livestock production, and population-based regulating services (e.g., pollination and biological control), which also linked to biodiversity. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation seemed unrelated to the three bundles. The similarities among the bundles in SA and northwestern Europe suggest that there are generalities in ES relations among natural and semi-natural grassland areas. We assessed trade-offs and synergies among services in relation to management practices and found that although some trade-offs are inevitable, appropriate management may create synergies and avoid trade-offs among many services. We argue that ecosystem service and food security research and policy should give higher priority to how grasslands can be managed for fodder and meat production alongside other ES. By integrating grasslands into agricultural production systems and land-use decisions locally and regionally, their potential to contribute to functional landscapes and to food security and sustainable livelihoods can be greatly enhanced.},

	abstract = {The intensification of farming practices negatively impacts the provision of many non-food ecosystem services (ES), including pollination, pest regulation and water quality regulation. Incorporating greater landscape heterogeneity in cropped areas, especially by increasing crop diversity and the density of field edges (i.e. greater farmland heterogeneity), may be a key lever to increase non-food ES provision in agricultural landscapes. However, most work to date focuses on the effects of farmland heterogeneity on biodiversity or on a single ES at a single spatial scale. Understanding how farmland heterogeneity affects multiple ES across spatial scales is critical to exploring whether increasing this heterogeneity is a feasible management solution to increase ES provision in agricultural landscapes. We measured the effects of farmland heterogeneity on the provision of eight key ES (crop production, soil fertility, water quality regulation, carbon storage, bee and syrphid pollination, and aphid and defoliator regulation) in the Montérégie, an important agricultural region in Quebec, Canada. We sampled 32 soybean fields embedded within landscapes that fell along independent gradients of mean field size and crop diversity. We evaluated the effects of heterogeneity on these eight ES at two spatial scales (500 m and 1000 m radii around fields), while controlling for the effects of in-field management practices. We found that the mean size of agricultural fields had a stronger influence on ES provision than crop diversity, especially at the 500 m scale. We observed varying responses to mean field size for different ES, which may lead to trade-offs for landscape management. Landscapes with smaller fields benefitted from greater bee pollination, water quality regulation and defoliator regulation, but had less crop production and aphid regulation. To further explore these trade-offs, we calculated the multiple ecosystem service landscape index to assess multifunctionality, but found no significant relationship between mean field size and multifunctionality and a negative relationship between crop diversity and multifunctionality. Our findings show that different ES respond differently to changes in heterogeneity, and efforts to manage heterogeneity to improve ES provision will need to acknowledge and understand possible trade-offs, particularly for crop production and pest regulation services.},

Studies should be based on a clear theoretical understanding of the processes that determine exposure. Even if the observed effects are large and rapidly follow implementation, confidence in attributing these effects to the intervention can be improved by carefully considering alternative explanations. Causal inference can be strengthened by including additional design features alongside the principal method of effect estimation. NE studies often rely on existing (including routinely collected) data. Investment in such data sources and the infrastructure for linking exposure and outcome data is essential if the potential for such studies to inform decision making is to be realized.},

The synthetic control method aims to estimate treatment effects by constructing a weighted combination of control units, which represents what the treated group would have experienced in the absence of receiving the treatment. While DiD estimation assumes that the effects of unobserved confounders are constant over time, the synthetic control method allows for these effects to change over time, by re-weighting the control group so that it has similar pre-intervention characteristics to the treated group. We extend the synthetic control approach to a setting of evaluation of a health policy where there are multiple treated units. We re-analyse a recent study evaluating the effects of a hospital P4P scheme on risk-adjusted hospital mortality. In contrast to the original DiD analysis, the synthetic control method reports that, for the incentivised conditions, the P4P scheme did not significantly reduce mortality and that there is a statistically significant increase in mortality for non-incentivised conditions. This result was robust to alternative specifications of the synthetic control method. © 2015 The Authors. Health Economics published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Understanding biodiversity changes in time is crucial to promptly provide management practices against diversity loss. This is overall true when considering global scales, since human-induced global change is expected to make significant changes on the Earth's biota. Biodiversity management and planning is mainly based on field observations related to community diversity, considering different taxa. However, such methods are time and cost demanding and do not allow in most cases to get temporal replicates. In this view, remote sensing can provide a wide data coverage in a short period of time. Recently, the use of Rao's Q diversity as a measure of spectral diversity has been proposed in order to explicitly take into account differences in a neighbourhood considering abundance and relative distance among pixels. The aim of this paper was to extend such a measure over the temporal dimension and to present an innovative approach to calculate remotely sensed temporal diversity. We demonstrated that temporal beta-diversity (spectral turnover) can be calculated pixel-wise in terms of both slope and coefficient of variation and further plotted over the whole matrix / image. From an ecological and operational point of view, for prioritisation practices in biodiversity protection, temporal variability could be beneficial in order to plan more efficient conservation practices starting from spectral diversity hotspots in space and time. In this paper, we delivered a highly reproducible approach to calculate spatio-temporal diversity in a robust and straightforward manner. Since it is based on open source code, we expect that our method will be further used by several researchers and landscape managers.},

Satellite remote sensing is one of the most cost-effective and comprehensive approaches to identify biodiversity hotspots and predict changes in species composition. This is because, in contrast to field-based methods, it allows for complete spatial coverages of the Earth's surface under study over a short period of time. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing provides repeated measures, thus making it possible to study temporal changes in biodiversity. While taxonomic diversity measures have long been established, problems arising from abundance related measures have not been yet disentangled. Moreover, little has been done to account for functional diversity besides taxonomic diversity measures. The aim of this manuscript is to propose robust measures of remotely sensed heterogeneity to perform exploratory analysis for the detection of hotspots of taxonomic and functional diversity of plant species.},

	abstract = {Quasi-experimental methods increasingly are used to evaluate the impacts of conservation interventions by generating credible estimates of counterfactual baselines. These methods generally require large samples for statistical comparisons, presenting a challenge for evaluating innovative policies implemented within a few pioneering jurisdictions. Single jurisdictions often are studied using comparative methods, which rely on analysts’ selection of best case comparisons. The synthetic control method (SCM) offers one systematic and transparent way to select cases for comparison, from a sizeable pool, by focusing upon similarity in outcomes before the intervention. We explain SCM, then apply it to one local initiative to limit deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The municipality of Paragominas launched a multi-pronged local initiative in 2008 to maintain low deforestation while restoring economic production. This was a response to having been placed, due to high deforestation, on a federal “blacklist” that increased enforcement of forest regulations and restricted access to credit and output markets. The local initiative included mapping and monitoring of rural land plus promotion of economic alternatives compatible with low deforestation. The key motivation for the program may have been to reduce the costs of blacklisting. However its stated purpose was to limit deforestation, and thus we apply SCM to estimate what deforestation would have been in a (counterfactual) scenario of no local initiative. We obtain a plausible estimate, in that deforestation patterns before the intervention were similar in Paragominas and the synthetic control, which suggests that after several years, the initiative did lower deforestation (significantly below the synthetic control in 2012). This demonstrates that SCM can yield helpful land-use counterfactuals for single units, with opportunities to integrate local and expert knowledge and to test innovations and permutations on policies that are implemented in just a few locations.},

Analyses of such large-scale, natural experiments are common in the health and econometrics literature, where techniques have been developed to derive insight from large, noisy observational data sets. Here, we apply a technique from this literature, synthetic control, to assess landscape change with remote sensing data. The basic data requirements for synthetic control include (1) a discrete set of treated and untreated units, (2) a known date of treatment intervention, and (3) time series response data that include both pre- and post-treatment outcomes for all units. Synthetic control generates a response metric for treated units relative to a no-action alternative based on prior relationships between treated and unexposed groups. Using simulations and a case study involving a large-scale brush-clearing management event, we show how synthetic control can intuitively infer treatment effect sizes from satellite data, even in the presence of confounding noise from climate anomalies, long-term vegetation dynamics, or sensor errors. We find that accuracy depends on the number and quality of potential control units, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate control populations. Although we consider the synthetic control approach in the context of natural experiments with remote sensing data, we expect the methodology to have wider utility in ecology, particularly for systems with large, complex, and poorly replicated experimental units.},

	abstract = {Vegetation indices are important remotely sensed metrics for ecosystem monitoring and land surface process assessment, among which Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been most widely used. The newly launched Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor, together with its predecessor Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), provides continuous earth observations with an 8-day interval. The design improvements of the new sensor, including narrower near-infrared waveband, higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and greater radiometric sensitivity highlight the need for investigating the land surface observation properties, especially its consistency with data from its predecessors and other satellite sensors. This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of Landsat 8 OLI-derived NDVI against Landsat 7 ETM+ by cross-comparison and by comparing with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)-derived NDVIs as well as in-situ NDVI measurements. Simulations of Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and surface reflectance of broadleaf trees and water were conducted for Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 7 ETM+, and MODIS in order to evaluate the impact of band pass difference on NDVI calculation. Four consecutive pairs of Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data over China and Korea were examined, and NDVIs derived from TOA reflectance and surface reflectance by three atmospheric correction methods were evaluated. Both simulations and comparisons showed that NDVIs derived from atmospherically-corrected surface reflectance had good consistency, while the simulation showed that the agreement varied with atmospheric characteristics. The four pairs of Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ NDVI had a mean bias error within ±0.05, and R2 from 0.84 to 0.98. Vegetated land cover types were found to have better NDVI agreement than non-vegetated land cover types. Especially, Landsat 8 OLI consistently generated lower NDVI values in water area than Landsat 7 ETM+, which resulted from higher aerosol optical thickness in atmosphere. Landsat 8 OLI-derived NDVI showed better agreement with MODIS and GOCI NDVI than Landsat 7 ETM+, mainly on vegetated surfaces. Both Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ surface reflectance-derived NDVI agreed well with in-situ light emitting diode (LED) NDVI measurements at a homogeneous deciduous forest site. Landsat 8 OLI was also found to produce higher spatial variability of NDVIs than Landsat 7 ETM+ at vegetated and urban areas, but lower variability on water area. The overall good agreement between Landsat 8 OLI NDVI and Landsat 7 ETM+, MODIS and GOCI NDVIs as well as in-situ measurements ensures that it is reliable to integrate the new sensor observations with those from the multiple satellite sensors, given that the same atmospheric correction methods are applied. Furthermore, the greater NDVI contrast between vegetated areas and water areas, and the higher spatial variability of Landsat 8 OLI NDVI indicated that the new sensor has better capability in land surface process monitoring, such as land cover mapping, spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation growth, and drought assessment.},

	abstract = {Proper satellite-based crop monitoring applications at the farm-level often require near-daily imagery at medium to high spatial resolution. The combination of data from different ongoing satellite missions Sentinel 2 (ESA) and Landsat 7/8 (NASA) provides this unprecedented opportunity at a global scale; however, this is rarely implemented because these procedures are data demanding and computationally intensive. This study developed a robust stream processing for the harmonization of Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, connecting the benefit of coherent data structure, built-in functions and computational power in the Google Cloud. The harmonized surface reflectance images were generated for two agricultural schemes in Bekaa (Lebanon) and Ninh Thuan (Vietnam) during 2018–2019. We evaluated the performance of several pre-processing steps needed for the harmonization including the image co-registration, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions correction, topographic correction, and band adjustment. We found that the misregistration between Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images varied from 10 m in Ninh Thuan (Vietnam) to 32 m in Bekaa (Lebanon), and posed a great impact on the quality of the final harmonized data set if not treated. Analysis of a pair of overlapped L8-S2 images over the Bekaa region showed that, after the harmonization, all band-to-band spatial correlations were greatly improved. Finally, we demonstrated an application of the dense harmonized data set for crop mapping and monitoring. An harmonic (Fourier) analysis was applied to fit the detected unimodal, bimodal and trimodal shapes in the temporal NDVI patterns during one crop year in Ninh Thuan province. The derived phase and amplitude values of the crop cycles were combined with max-NDVI as an R-G-B false composite image. The final image was able to highlight croplands in bright colors (high phase and amplitude), while the non-crop areas were shown with grey/dark (low phase and amplitude). The harmonized data sets (with 30 m spatial resolution) along with the Google Earth Engine scripts used are provided for public use.},

However, our ability to produce these advanced data sets is hampered by the differences in design and function of the various optical remote-sensing satellite systems. A key factor is the impact that calibration of these instruments has on data interoperability. To address this issue, a workshop with a panel of experts was convened in conjunction with the Pecora 20 conference to focus on data interoperability between Landsat and the Sentinel 2 sensors. Four major areas of recommendation were the outcome of the workshop. The first was to improve communications between satellite agencies and the remote-sensing community. The second was to adopt a collections-based approach to processing the data. As expected, a third recommendation was to improve calibration methodologies in several specific areas. Lastly, and the most ambitious of the four, was to develop a comprehensive process for validating surface reflectance products produced from the data sets. Collectively, these recommendations have significant potential for improving satellite sensor calibration in a focused manner that can directly catalyze efforts to develop data that are closer to being seamlessly interoperable.},

Vegetation indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), were generated for the study area in addition to the five corresponding bands of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 OLI Images. Although the spectral consistency of the data was interpreted by cross-calibration analysis using the Pearson correlation coefficient, spatial consistency was evaluated by descriptive statistical analysis of investigated variables. In general, the highest correlation values were achieved for the images that were acquired in the spring season for almost all investigated variables. In the spring season, among the investigated variables, the Red band (B4), NDVI and EVI have the largest correlation coefficients of 0.94, 0.92 and 0.91, respectively. Regarding the spatial consistency, the mean and standard deviation values of all variables were consistent for all seasons except for the mean value of the NDVI for the fall season. As a result, if there is no atmospheric effect or data retrieval/acquisition error, either Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 can be used as a combination or to provide the continuity data in longos monitoring applications. This study contributes to longos forest monitoring science in terms of remote sensing data analysis.},

While these should, in principle, give broadly comparable measurements, any differences are a function not only of the differences in the sensor responses, but also of the spectral characteristics of the target pixels. In order to test for and quantify differences between these sensors, a large set of coincident imagery was assembled for the Australian landscape. Comparisons were carried out in terms of surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical quantities estimated from the reflectances. Small but consistent differences were found, and suitable adjustment equations fitted to enable transformation of Sentinel-2A reflectance values to more closely match Landsat-7 or Landsat-8 values. This is useful if trying to take models and thresholds fitted from Landsat and use them with Sentinel-2. The fitted adjustment equations were also compared against those fitted globally for NASA’s Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 product, and found to be substantially different, raising the possibility that such adjustments need to be fitted on a regional basis.},

The development of landscape policy to protect and improve landscape attractiveness, thereby ensuring the provision of ecosystem services, is ideally adapted to region specific landscape characteristics. In addition, trends in landscape attractiveness may be linked to certain policies, or the absence of policies over time. A spatial and temporal evaluation of landscape attractiveness is thus desirable for landscape policy development. In this paper, landscape attractiveness was spatially evaluated for Flanders (Belgium) using landscape indicators derived from geospatial data as a case study. Large local differences in landscape quality in (i) rural versus urban areas and (ii) between the seven agricultural regions in Flanders were found. This observed spatial variability in landscape attractiveness demonstrated that a localized approach, considering the geophysical characteristics of each individual region, would be required in the development of landscape policy to improve landscape quality in Flanders. Some trends in landscape attractiveness were related to agriculture in Flanders, e.g., a slight decrease in total agricultural area, decrease in dominance of grassland, maize and cereals, a decrease in crop diversity, sharp increase in the adoption of agri-environmental agreements (AEA) and a decrease in bare soil conditions in winter. The observed trends and spatial variation in landscape attractiveness can be used as a tool to support policy analysis, assess the potential effects of future policy plans, identify policy gaps and evaluate past landscape policy.},

	abstract = {Landsat is among the most popular satellites used for forest change assessments. Traditionally, Landsat data users relied on annual or biennial images to measure forest recovery after disturbance, a process that is difficult to monitor at broad scales. With the availability of free Landsat data, intra-annual change analyses are now possible. Phenology, the timing of cyclical vegetation events, can be estimated using indices derived from intra-annual remote sensing data and used to classify different vegetation types after a disturbance. We used a smoothed harmonic modelling approach to estimate NDVI and NBR phenology patterns in pre- and post-fire Landsat sample pixels for two forest groups in South Carolina, using nearby unburned samples as an approximate control group. These methods take advantage of all available images collected by Landsat 5, 7, and 8 for the study area. We found that within burned samples, there were differences in phenology for the two forest groups, while the unburned samples showed no forest group differences. Phenology patterns also differed based on fire severity. These methods take advantage of the freely available Landsat archive and can be used to characterize intra-annual fluctuations in vegetation following a variety of disturbances in the southeastern U.S. and other regions. Our approach builds on other harmonic approaches that use the Landsat archive to detect forest change, such as the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm, and provides a tool to describe post-disturbance forest change.},

	abstract = {Forest systems provide crucial ecosystem functions to our environment, such as balancing carbon stocks and influencing the local, regional and global climate. A trend towards an increasing frequency of climate change induced extreme weather events, including drought, is hereby a major challenge for forest management. Within this context, the application of remote sensing data provides a powerful means for fast, operational and inexpensive investigations over large spatial scales and time. This study was dedicated to explore the potential of satellite data in combination with harmonic analyses for quantifying the vegetation response to drought events in German forests. The harmonic modelling method was compared with a z-score standardization approach and correlated against both, meteorological and topographical data. Optical satellite imagery from Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used in combination with three commonly applied vegetation indices. Highest correlation scores based on the harmonic modelling technique were computed for the 6th harmonic degree. MODIS imagery in combination with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) generated hereby best results for measuring spectral response to drought conditions. Strongest correlation between remote sensing data and meteorological measures were observed for soil moisture and the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). Furthermore, forests regions over sandy soils with pine as the dominant tree type were identified to be particularly vulnerable to drought. In addition, topographical analyses suggested mitigated drought affects along hill slopes. While the proposed approaches provide valuable information about vegetation dynamics as a response to meteorological weather conditions, standardized in-situ measurements over larger spatial scales and related to drought quantification are required for further in-depth quality assessment of the used methods and data.},

Here, we investigate countrywide patterns of changes in residential density and residential nature at high spatial resolution over a time period of {\textgreater}20 years (1995–2016), combining a dataset of address-level population data covering all of Denmark ({\textgreater}2 million address points) with satellite image-derived normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Our results show that many residential environments across Denmark have witnessed simultaneous densification and greening since the mid-1990s. In fact, the most common change within 500 m neighbourhoods around individual address points is of joint increases in population and NDVI (28\%), followed by increasing NDVI with stable population figures (21\%). In contrast, only 8\% of neighbourhoods around address points have seen a decline in either population or NDVI. Results were similar in low- middle- and high-density environments, suggesting that trends were driven by climate change but also to some degree enabled by urban planning policies that seek to increase rather than decrease nature in the cities.},

Previous studies have used spectral-temporal metrics derived from annual Landsat time series to identify disturbance agents. Here, we extend this approach to new predictors derived from intra-annual time series and test it at three sites in Central Europe, including managed and protected forests. The two newly tested predictors are: (1) intra-annual timing of disturbance events and (2) temporal proximity to windstorms based on prior knowledge. We estimated the intra-annual timing of disturbances using a breakpoint detection algorithm and all available Landsat observations between 1984 and 2016. Using spectral, temporal, and topography-related metrics, we then mapped four disturbance classes: windthrow, cleared windthrow, bark beetles, and other harvest. Disturbance agents were identified with overall accuracies of 76–86\%. Temporal proximity to storm events was among the most important predictors, while intra-annual timing itself was less important. Moreover, elevation information was very effective for discriminating disturbance agents. Our results demonstrate the potential of incorporating dense, intra-annual Landsat time series information and prior knowledge of disturbance events for monitoring forest ecosystem change at the disturbance agent level.},

	abstract = {Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) are currently operational for routine Earth observation. There are substantial differences between instruments onboard both satellites. The enhancements achieved with Landsat-8 refer to the scanning technology (replacing of whisk-broom scanners with two separate push-broom OLI and TIRS scanners), an extended number of spectral bands (two additional bands provided) and narrower bandwidths. Therefore, cross-comparative analysis is very necessary for the combined use of multi-decadal Landsat imagery. In this study, 3,311 independent sample points of four major land cover types (primary forest, unplanted cropland, swidden cultivation and water body) were used to compare the spectral bands of ETM+ and OLI. Eight sample plots with different land cover types were manually selected for comparison with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). These indices were calculated with six pairs of ETM+ and OLI cloud-free images, which were acquired over the border area of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand just two days apart, when Landsat-8 achieved operational obit. Comparative results showed that: (1) the average surface reflectance of each band differed slightly, but with a high degree of similarities between both sensors. In comparison with ETM+, the OLI had higher values for the near-infrared band for vegetative land cover types, but lower values for non-vegetative types. The new sensor had lower values for the shortwave infrared (2.11–2.29 µm) band for all land cover types. In addition, it also basically had higher values for the shortwave infrared (1.57–1.65 µm) band for non-water land cover types. (2) The subtle differences of vegetation indices derived from both sensors and their high linear correlation coefficient (R2 \&gt; 0.96) demonstrated that ETM+ and OLI imagery can be used as complementary data. (3) LSWI and NBR performed better than NDVI and MNDWI for cross-comparison analysis of satellite sensors, due to the spectral band difference effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Landsat 8, the ongoing mission of the Landsat satellites that have provided over 40 years of images, continues to benefit long-term research. However, it is important to know if the spectral features of Landsat 8 are of the same standard as previous Landsat imagery because Landsat 8 images have narrower bands, especially because of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculation which is the most popular vegetation index. In this study NDVI values derived from Landsat 8 images were compared with those calculated from Landsat 7 and ground measured hyperspectral data. The result shows that Landsat 8 NDVI is larger than Landsat 7 NDVI in lower vegetation covered areas and the difference becomes smaller as the value of NDVI increases. This indicates that NDVI of Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 is consistent when dealing with high vegetation covered areas (e.g. forest area and tall grass prairie) because the difference between Landsat 7 and 8 NDVI is close to zero when the value of NDVI is high, but this needs to be further investigated. There is also further need for calibration of NDVI in low vegetation covered areas in order to achieve consistency between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images.},

The appealing scaling properties of neural networks have recently led to a surge of interest in differentiable neural network-based methods for learning causal structures from data. So far differentiable causal discovery has focused on static datasets of observational or interventional origin. In this work, we introduce an active intervention-targeting mechanism which enables a quick identification of the underlying causal structure of the data-generating process. Our method significantly reduces the required number of interactions compared with random intervention targeting and is applicable for both discrete and continuous optimization formulations of learning the underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) from data. We examine the proposed method across a wide range of settings and demonstrate superior performance on multiple benchmarks from simulated to real-world data.},

Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},
