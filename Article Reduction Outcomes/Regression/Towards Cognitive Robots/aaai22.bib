AI2-THOR consists of near photo-realistic 3D indoor scenes, where AI agents can navigate in the scenes and interact with objects to perform tasks. AI2-THOR enables research in many different domains including but not limited to deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, learning by interaction, planning, visual question answering, unsupervised representation learning, object detection and segmentation, and learning models of cognition. The goal of AI2-THOR is to facilitate building visually intelligent models and push the research forward in this domain.},

	abstract = {Visual recognition ecosystems (e.g. ImageNet, Pascal, COCO) have undeniably played a prevailing role in the evolution of modern computer vision. We argue that interactive and embodied visual AI has reached a stage of development similar to visual recognition prior to the advent of these ecosystems. Recently, various synthetic environments have been introduced to facilitate research in embodied AI. Notwithstanding this progress, the crucial question of how well models trained in simulation generalize to reality has remained largely unanswered. The creation of a comparable ecosystem for simulation-to-real embodied AI presents many challenges: (1) the inherently interactive nature of the problem, (2) the need for tight alignments between real and simulated worlds, (3) the difficulty of replicating physical conditions for repeatable experiments, (4) and the associated cost. In this paper, we introduce RoboTHOR to democratize research in interactive and embodied visual AI. RoboTHOR offers a framework of simulated environments paired with physical counterparts to systematically explore and overcome the challenges of simulation-to-real transfer, and a platform where researchers across the globe can remotely test their embodied models in the physical world. As a first benchmark, our experiments show there exists a significant gap between the performance of models trained in simulation when they are tested in both simulations and their carefully constructed physical analogs. We hope that RoboTHOR will spur the next stage of evolution in embodied computer vision. RoboTHOR can be accessed at the following link: https://ai2thor.allenai.org/robothor},

	abstract = {The domain of Embodied AI has recently witnessed substantial progress, particularly in navigating agents within their environments. These early successes have laid the building blocks for the community to tackle tasks that require agents to actively interact with objects in their environment. Object manipulation is an established research domain within the robotics community and poses several challenges including manipulator motion, grasping and long-horizon planning, particularly when dealing with oft-overlooked practical setups involving visually rich and complex scenes, manipulation using mobile agents (as opposed to tabletop manipulation), and generalization to unseen environments and objects. We propose a framework for object manipulation built upon the physics-enabled, visually rich AI2-THOR framework and present a new challenge to the Embodied AI community known as ArmPointNav. This task extends the popular point navigation task to object manipulation and offers new challenges including 3D obstacle avoidance, manipulating objects in the presence of occlusion, and multi-object manipulation that necessitates long term planning. Popular learning paradigms that are successful on PointNav challenges show promise, but leave a large room for improvement.},

We examine concurrent effects of explicit propensity to trust machines and implicit attitudes toward automation on trust in an automated system. We examine differential impacts of each under varying automation performance conditions (clearly good, ambiguous, clearly poor).Method:Participants completed both a self-report measure of propensity to trust and an Implicit Association Test measuring implicit attitude toward automation, then performed an X-ray screening task. Automation performance was manipulated within-subjects by varying the number and obviousness of errors.Results:Explicit propensity to trust and implicit attitude toward automation did not significantly correlate. When the automation?s performance was ambiguous, implicit attitude significantly affected automation trust, and its relationship with propensity to trust was additive: Increments in either were related to increases in trust. When errors were obvious, a significant interaction between the implicit and explicit measures was found, with those high in both having higher trust.Conclusion:Implicit attitudes have important implications for automation trust.Application:Users may not be able to accurately report why they experience a given level of trust. To understand why users trust or fail to trust automation, measurements of implicit and explicit predictors may be necessary. Furthermore, implicit attitude toward automation might be used as a lever to effectively calibrate trust.},

A 3-phased experiment, comprising a word elicitation study, a questionnaire study, and a paired comparison study, was performed to better understand similarities and differences in the concepts of trust and distrust, and among the different types of trust. Results indicated that trust and distrust can be considered opposites, rather than different concepts. Components of trust, in terms of words related to trust, were similar across the three types of trust. Results obtained from a cluster analysis were used to identify 12 potential factors of trust between people and automated systems. These 12 factors were then used to develop a proposed scale to measure trust in automation.},

Chauncey Starr has proposed that economic data be used to reveal patterns of acceptable risk-benefit tradeoffs. The present study investigates an alternative technique, in which psychometric procedures were used to elicit quantitative judgments of perceived risk, acceptable risk, and perceived benefit for each of 30 activities and technologies. The participants were seventy-six members of the League of Women Voters. The results indicated little systematic relationship between perceived existing risks and benefits of the 30 risk items. Current risk levels were generally viewed as unacceptably high. When current risk levels were adjusted to what would be considered acceptable risk levels, however, risk was found to correlate with benefit. Nine descriptive attributes of risk were also studied. These nine attributes seemed to tap two basic dimensions of risk. These dimensions proved to be effective predictors of the tradeoff between acceptable risk and perceived benefit. The limitations of the present study and the relationship between this technique and Starr's technique are discussed, along with the implications of the findings for policy decisions.},

In this initial study, we explore whether these different aspects of trust can be considered parts of a multidimensional conception and measure of trust. We gathered 62 words from dictionaries and trust literatures and asked participants to evaluate the words as belonging to a "personal" meaning or a "capacity" meaning. Through an iterative process using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and item analysis, we derived four components that capture the multidimensional space occupied by the concept of trust. The resulting four components yield four subscales of trust with five items each and alpha reliabilities as follows: Capable = .88, Ethical = .87, Sincere = .84, and Reliable = .72.},

	abstract = {Trust in human-robot interactions (HRI) is measured in two main ways: through subjective questionnaires and through behavioral tasks. To optimize measurements of trust through questionnaires, the field of HRI faces two challenges: the development of standardized measures that apply to a variety of robots with different capabilities, and the exploration of social and relational dimensions of trust in robots (e.g., benevolence). In this paper we look at how different trust questionnaires (Lyons \& Guznov, 2019; Schaefer, 2016; Ullman \& Malle, 2018) fare given these challenges that pull in different directions (being general vs. being exploratory) by studying whether people think the items in these questionnaires are applicable to different kinds of robots and interactions. In Study 1 we show that after being presented with a robot (non-humanoid) and an interaction scenario (fire evacuation), participants rated multiple questionnaire items such as "This robot is principled" as "Non-applicable to robots in general" or "Non-applicable to this robot." In Study 2 we show that the frequency of these ratings change (indeed, even for items rated as N/A to robots in general) when a new scenario is presented (game playing with a humanoid robot). Finally, while overall trust scores remained robust to N/A ratings, our results revealed potential fallacies in the way these scores are commonly interpreted. We conclude with recommendations for the development, use and results-reporting of trust questionnaires for future studies, as well as theoretical implications for the field of HRI.},

	abstract = {The introduction of artificial teammates in the form of autonomous social robots, with fewer social abilities compared to humans, presents new challenges for human–robot team dynamics. A key characteristic of high performing human-only teams is their ability to establish, develop, and calibrate trust over long periods of time, making the establishment of longitudinal human–robot team trust calibration a crucial part of these challenges. This paper presents a novel integrative model that takes a longitudinal perspective on trust development and calibration in human–robot teams. A key new proposed factor in this model is the introduction of the concept relationship equity. Relationship equity is an emotional resource that predicts the degree of goodwill between two actors. Relationship equity can help predict the future health of a long-term relationship. Our model is descriptive of current trust dynamics, predictive of the impact on trust of interactions within a human–robot team, and prescriptive with respect to the types of interventions and transparency methods promoting trust calibration. We describe the interplay between team trust dynamics and the establishment of work agreements that guide and improve human–robot collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce methods for dampening (reducing overtrust) and repairing (reducing undertrust) mis-calibrated trust between team members as well as methods for transparency and explanation. We conclude with a description of the implications of our model and a research agenda to jump-start a new comprehensive research program in this area.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence and algorithmic decision-making processes are increasingly criticized for their black-box nature. Explainable AI approaches to trace human-interpretable decision processes from algorithms have been explored. Yet, little is known about algorithmic explainability from a human factors’ perspective. From the perspective of user interpretability and understandability, this study examines the effect of explainability in AI on user trust and attitudes toward AI. It conceptualizes causability as an antecedent of explainability and as a key cue of an algorithm and examines them in relation to trust by testing how they affect user perceived performance of AI-driven services. The results show the dual roles of causability and explainability in terms of its underlying links to trust and subsequent user behaviors. Explanations of why certain news articles are recommended generate users trust whereas causability of to what extent they can understand the explanations affords users emotional confidence. Causability lends the justification for what and how should be explained as it determines the relative importance of the properties of explainability. The results have implications for the inclusion of causability and explanatory cues in AI systems, which help to increase trust and help users to assess the quality of explanations. Causable explainable AI will help people understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms by bringing transparency and accountability into AI systems.},

Researchers, designers, and engineers have proposed socially assistive robots as one way of helping elderly people stay in their homes longer. In a systematic literature review, this paper wants to investigate if and how evaluations of the acceptance of socially assistive robots by older people take into account sociodemographic factors. The results indicate that this only holds true for a few studies. Research that incorporates age, gender, education, and so forth; clearly shows that these key factors have a significant impact. However, the relations are complex and experience with technology mitigates the influence of sociodemographic factors on acceptance. Assistive devices should be adaptable to individual needs to be able to consider all these factors.},

The objective of this review was to assess the published effects and effectiveness of robot interventions aiming at social assistance in elderly care. We searched, using Medical Subject Headings terms and free words, in the CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane, BIOMED, PUBMED, PsycINFO, and EMBASE databases. Also the IEEE Digital Library was searched. No limitations were applied for the date of publication. Only articles written in English were taken into account. Collected publications went through a selection process. In the first step, publications were collected from major databases using a search query. In the second step, 3 reviewers independently selected publications on their title, using predefined selection criteria. In the third step, publications were judged based on their abstracts by the same reviewers, using the same selection criteria. In the fourth step, one reviewer made the final selection of publications based on complete content. Finally, 41 publications were included in the review, describing 17 studies involving 4 robot systems. Most studies reported positive effects of companion-type robots on (socio)psychological (eg, mood, loneliness, and social connections and communication) and physiological (eg, stress reduction) parameters. The methodological quality of the studies was, mostly, low. Although positive effects were reported, the scientific value of the evidence was limited. The positive results described, however, prompt further effectiveness research in this field.},

Assistive technologies like Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) are being considered as enablers to support the process of care giving or keep elderly at home longer. This article reports a mixed-method systematic review of SAR in elderly care and recognizes its impact on elderly well-being, integrating evidence from qualitative and quantitative studies. It follows the principles explained in Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and classifies interventions, measures, and outcomes of field trials of SAR in elderly care. Eighty-six studies in 37 study groups have been included. The findings imply positive effects of SAR on elderly well-being. Ten significant recommendations are made to help avoid the current limitations of existing research and to improve future research and its applicability. This review revealed that SAR can potentially enhance elderly well-being and decrease the workload on caregivers. There is a need for rigorous research methodology, person-centered care, caregiver expectation model, multimodal interaction, multimodal data collection, and modeling of culturally diverse groups to facilitate acceptability of SAR.},

	abstract = {Socially Assistive Robots (SAR) may help improve care delivery at home for older adults with cognitive impairment and reduce the burden of informal caregivers. Examining the views of these stakeholders on SAR is fundamental in order to conceive acceptable and useful SAR for dementia care. This study investigated SAR acceptance among three groups of older adults living in the community: persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment, informal caregivers of persons with dementia, and healthy older adults. Different technology acceptance questions related to the robot and user characteristics, potential applications, feelings about technology, ethical issues, and barriers and facilitators for SAR adoption, were addressed in a mixed-method study. Participants (n = 25) completed a survey and took part in a focus group (n = 7). A functional robot prototype, a multimedia presentation, and some use-case scenarios provided a base for the discussion. Content analysis was carried out based on recorded material from focus groups. Results indicated that an accurate insight of influential factors for SAR acceptance could be gained by combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants acknowledged the potential benefits of SAR for supporting care at home for individuals with cognitive impairment. In all the three groups, intention to use SAR was found to be lower for the present time than that anticipated for the future. However, caregivers and persons with MCI had a higher perceived usefulness and intention to use SAR, at the present time, than healthy older adults, confirming that current needs are strongly related to technology acceptance and should influence SAR design. A key theme that emerged in this study was the importance of customizing SAR appearance, services, and social capabilities. Mismatch between needs and solutions offered by the robot, usability factors, and lack of experience with technology, were seen as the most important barriers for SAR adoption.},

	abstract = {Demographic developments have challenged our research on how to assist elderly people by using robots. The KSERA (Knowledgeable SErvice Robots for Aging) project integrates smart home technology and a socially-assistive robot to extend independent living for elderly people, in particular those with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). The social robot is the most visible component of the system playing the role of communication interface between the elderly, the smart home, and the external world. The robot’s behavior is determined in part by sensor information gathered through the smart home. To ensure user acceptance, we used user-centered design to implement the robot’s behavior. This paper describes the KSERA system, how it was developed based on user needs, treatment plans, and lab studies, and how we validated the approach through user studies and field trials. The key enabling technologies for successful socially-assistive robots include person- and self-localization abilities, person-aware navigation, speech recognition and generation, robot gestures, emulated emotions, eye contact and joint attention, and audio-video communication with family members and care givers.},

Rather than viewing aging as a problem to be fixed (i.e., a deficit model of aging), many aging researchers are viewing aging as a developmental stage of life to be celebrated and supported, that is, “successful aging.” In this article, we embrace this approach and consider it in the context of assistive robot design in an aim to steer the conversation away from deficit models that have limited robot design possibilities. To explore an alternative design approach to the study of aging in human-robot interaction (HRI), we invited five aging researchers (three geriatricians, one gerontologist, and one epidemiologist) and nine older adults to participate in our research. In the study, participants illustrated their interpretations of aging and suggested potential assistive robots. We found that while all participants perceived the importance of potential disabilities due to aging, they considered potential disabilities as only one aspect of the experience of aging. They highlighted other key themes to consider in designing robots to support successful aging, such as older adults’ autonomy and resilience. We discuss these findings for the HRI community and call for “robots for successful aging.”},

	abstract = {The near future will see an increasing demand of elder care and a shortage of professional and informal caregivers. In this context, ageing societies would benefit from the design of intelligent homes that provide assistance. The choice of interfaces between the assistive environment and the user is of great importance and determines the degree of user acceptance of this technology. Socially assistive robots are one of the most promising interfaces. Their embodiment and multimodal communication channels could potentially provide a large number of services that otherwise would have to be carried out by a variety of dedicated systems. Furthermore, evidence suggests that people perceive robots more as companions and social actors than tools and this is likely to steer user acceptance positively. This paper presents the authors' work related to the EU-FP7 project KSERA, a project that aims at introducing a socially assistive robot that acts as a proactive communication interface in smart home environments. In particular, it gives an overview of (1) human--robot interaction studies conducted in Eindhoven (The Netherlands) whose general aim was to preliminary assess the added value of socially assistive robots in intelligent homes and (2) the KSERA project field trials in Schwechat (Vienna) and Tel Aviv (Israel) that tested an integrated smart-home/robot system with real end users (N=16) in three real-world scenarios. Overall, results show that socially assistive robots positively affect user experience and motivation compared to standard smart environment interfaces such as touch screens. However, people still tend to prefer conventional interfaces for receiving information.},

While high-level behaviors are selected based on the state of the user as well as the interaction, reinforcement learning is used within each behavior to optimize its local mapping onto lower-level behaviors. The approach is implemented and applied in a scenario in which a social robot (Furhat) assists a human player in solving a Memory game by guiding the attention of the user to target objects. Results of an evaluation study demonstrate that participants are able to solve the Memory faster with the adaptive, assistive robot.},

	abstract = {Modern assistive systems, such as robots, will have increasing relevance for support at home in the future due to changes in society, such as ageing. Older people, especially, can benefit from assistive robots that give physical, cognitive and emotional support. However, thus far, little is understood of how to increase currently low acceptance of assistive robots through marketing (DAA Design Brief, Acceptance of assistive technology, 2014). Therefore, marketing strategies need to be developed addressing needs and fears of the stakeholders, which is especially critical regarding utopian-appearing assistive robots. To understand what drives acceptance, conscious and subconscious needs, wants and barriers of use of the relevant stakeholders have to be analysed. As such, in this intelligence gathering process not only end-users should be integrated. Also other stakeholders (e.g. as users, decision makers and buyers might not be identical) should be identified and their needs understood. In this paper we report our findings on marketing factors for different stakeholder clusters for assistive robots that we identified during the EU-co-funded (FP7) Robot-Era project. We employed a user-centred way of identifying stakeholders and marketing strategies by analysing different stakeholders in an iterative design process from an early stage (Mollenkopf et al., AAL in der alternden Gesellschaft: Anforderungen, Akzeptanz und Perspektiven, 2010) with quantitative and qualitative methods. The most important acceptance factors we identified for assistive robotics include functionality, usability, safety, costs and financing, (non-) stigmatization and ethical aspects. The structure of the paper is the following: first we look at the relevance of assistive robotics and the challenge of missing acceptance. We then look at the 4p concept in marketing to structure our approach of user-centered marketing. We then describe our data collection and the results to end with a discussion.},

In this paper, we describe our novel ideas on the development of assistive robots which fit the real needs of users based on ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health), which is a part of the WHO Family of International Classifications for describing whole activities of a person in daily lives. By utilizing ICF, the development process of assistive robots - analyzing and discovering needs in daily lives, designing robots and evaluating the products - will be achieved in an objective manner.},

	abstract = {The current paper addresses the implications of doing research on socially assistive robots in real homes. In contrast to laboratory studies, studies of robots in their intended natural environments can provide insights into people’s experiences of robots, and if and how a robot becomes embedded and used in people’s everyday life. However, moving robots out of the lab and into real life environments poses several challenges. Laboratory methods mainly focus on cause-and-effect relations between independent and dependent variables, while researchers who are conducting studies in real homes have much less control. In home trials, researchers need to decide what kind of data is obtainable and available. In real homes, researchers face unique challenges that require unique and pragmatic approaches. Any single study conducted in a real home is likely to have methodological limitations. Therefore, several different studies using different robots and methods are needed before the results can be converged in order to reach conclusions that are convincingly supported. This paper is an effort to provide such a report on a specific empirical case and converging findings from other studies. The goal is to provide an account of the research challenges and opportunities encountered when introducing a robot into its intended practice: the homes of older people. The aim is to give enough details for other researchers to critically examine and systematically build on the insights and findings presented.},

	abstract = {To address manpower shortages, health care leaders recommend technology, including robots, to facilitate and augment processes for delivery of efficient, safe care. Little is known regarding older adults' perceptions of socially assistive robots (SARs). Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology framework, a survey was developed and tested for capturing older adults' likelihood to use SARs. The Robot Acceptance Survey (RAS) comprises three subscales: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Attitude. Older adults completed the RAS pre- and post-experimental procedure with a SAR. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the subscales ranged from 0.77 to 0.89. Subscales were sensitive to change, with more positive reactions after exposure to SAR activities. Future studies must identify robotic programming capable of providing cognitive, physical, and social assistance, as well as person-, activity-, situation-, and robot-specific factors that will influence older adults' acceptance of SARs.

	abstract = {Socially assistive robotics aims at providing users with continuous support and personalized assistance, through appropriate social interactions. The design of robots capable of supporting people in heterogeneous tasks, raises several challenges among which the most relevant are the need to realise intelligent and continuous behaviours, robustness and flexibility of services and, furthermore, the ability to adapt to different contexts and needs. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in realizing cognitive capabilities like e.g., learning, context reasoning or planning that are highly needed in socially assistive robots. The integration of several of such capabilities is an open problem. This paper proposes a novel “cognitive approach” integrating ontology-based knowledge reasoning, automated planning and execution technologies. The core idea is to endow assistive robots with intelligent features in order to reason at different levels of abstraction, understand specific health-related needs and decide how to act in order to perform personalized assistive tasks. The paper presents such a cognitive approach pointing out the contribution of different knowledge contexts and perspectives, presents detailed functioning traces to show adaptation and personalization features, and finally discusses an experimental assessment proving the feasibility of the approach.},

This paper presents an evaluation of elderly people's perception of assistive robots and smart domotic environments. Results show how the acceptability of robotic devices in home setting does not depend only on the practical benefits they can provide, but also on complex relationships between the cognitive, affective and emotional components of people's images of robot. Specially, we analyzes a number of evaluation criteria related to the robot's aspect, the way in which it communicates with the user, and the perceived usefulness of its support services. Among these criteria, the paper proposes and reports an evaluation of how perceived frailty, with reference to both health in general and fear of cognitive weakening, more specifically, can influence the evaluation of a potential aid in everyday life, namely the robotic assistant. The paper also provides a discussion which can be useful for the design of future assistive agents and socially interactive robotic.},

Information-Comunication Technologies (ICT) applications can considerably contribute to improve the CS. A deeper knowledge and experience in this field is needed to allow the application of ICT concepts and approaches to the CS treatment of AD. We reviewed the literature and identified systematic reviews of cohort studies, and other authoritative reports. Our selection criteria for CS and ICT in Alzheimer’s disease included: (1) CS, (2) ICT, and (3) AD. We identified 154 studies published between 2000 and 2015, of which 9 met inclusion criteria. Most studies reported that older adults with AD need to be technologically savvy in order to successfully complete or benefit from training. All the studies on small samples show that the introduction of ad-hoc ICT tools are accepted, used and could improve the quality of life increasing the permanence at home. From the state of the art point of view some researchers have investigated new solutions for cognitive assistance in the last three years (serious games and robotic systems). The research consisted in exploiting software platform allowing the support of new assistive tools that are less expensive and more accessible and could be used as a re-education tool helping to slow the decline of people suffering from AD. Most of ICT solutions provided memory challenges and improved brain performances.},

And finally, who should bear the burden of paying the insurance premium? The objective of this article is to provide the reader with an overview on the issue of risk management of robotic applications through insurance contracts. Indeed, insurance products are essential for an effective technology transfer from research to market. As of today, the production, use and diffusion of robots, determines risks that can hardly be identified and assessed both with respect to the probability of their occurrence and to the consequences they might bring about. Thence, innovation causes existing insurance products to be inadequate, and often times, it leaves insurance companies in the complex position of needing to elaborate new solutions in the absence of complete information. This article discusses the reasons for those hindrances and identifies the essential issues that lawyers, economists and engineers need to address in their future research in order to overcome current limitations and ultimately develop efficient and adequate risk management tools.},

The system performs a range of services including data collection and analysis of long term trends in behaviors and physiological parameters (e.g. relating to sleep or daily activity); warnings, alarms and reminders; and social interaction through the telepresence robot. The latter is based on the Giraff telepresence robot, which is already in place in a number of homes. A distinctive aspect of the project is that the GiraffPlus system will be installed and evaluated in at least 15 homes of elderly people.

Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often health conditions can detrimentally affect a person’s ability to interact with others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health. For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below. We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform, motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have. In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform: (a) changing how the person is perceived, (b) enhancing the social behavior of the person, (c) modifying the social behavior of others, (d) providing structure for interactions, and (e) changing how the person feels. We thematically organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human–human interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.},

Assistive robotics can represent a concrete support providing also a support for caregivers, clinicians and nurses by reducing their burden.Methods A total of 20 older people and 34 caregivers (formal and informal) were interviewed in Italy and the Netherlands to investigate and prioritize their needs concerning the personal mobility domains and their attitudes towards assistive robots. The data were analysed from a user point of view by means of thematic content analysis by underlying recurrent topics.Results The results revealed four categories of needs from the perspective of the older individuals: instrumental needs, rehabilitation needs, personal safety and indoor activities of daily life. Additionally, the results underline how personal mobility issues influence different aspects of daily life. Complementarily, three categories of caregiver needs were also distinguished: instrumental needs, rehabilitation monitoring needs and checkup needs. The highest percentage of participants showed a positive expectation towards assistive robotics.Conclusions The results were clustered according to the robot abilities (i.e., motion, interaction, manipulation, decision support and perception abilities) as a list of functional and technical requirements that should be developed to address all the needs related to the personal mobility. Robotic developer teams that work in this context could take advantage of this research. Additionally, this work can be used as a basis for clinicians and nurses working in geriatric units to understand how the robots can support and enhance their work.Implications for rehabilitationThe incidence of personal mobility limitations affects 35\% of adults age 70 and older and 72\% of people over 80 years of age.Assistive robots can support elderly people during daily tasks: they could promote their personal mobility acting as a supporting tool.The results of the needs analysis revealed four categories of needs from the perspective of the older individuals: instrumental needs, rehabilitation needs, personal safety, and indoor activities of daily life.Three categories of caregiver needs were also distinguished: instrumental needs, rehabilitation monitoring needs, and check-up needs.},

We frame SARs development in the context of preventive patient-centered healthcare, which empowers patients as the primary drivers of health and aims to delay the onset of disease rather than focusing on treatment. After describing how SARs can be of benefit in this form of healthcare, we detail our participatory design study with older adults and therapists aimed at developing preventive SARs applications for this population. We found therapists and older adults to be willing and able to participate in assistive robot design, though hands-on participation was a challenge. Our findings suggest that important areas of concern for older adults with depression are social interaction and companionship, as well as technologies that are easy to use and require minimal intervention.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates three different technologies for solving a planning and scheduling problem of deploying multiple robots in a retirement home environment to assist elderly residents. The models proposed make use of standard techniques and solvers developed in AI planning and scheduling, with two primary motivations. First, to find a planning and scheduling solution that we can deploy in our real-world application. Second, to evaluate planning and scheduling technology in terms of the ``model-and-solve'' functionality that forms a major research goal in both domain-independent planning and constraint programming. Seven variations of our application are studied using the following three technologies: PDDL-based planning, time-line planning and scheduling, and constraint-based scheduling. The variations address specific aspects of the problem that we believe can impact the performance of the technologies while also representing reasonable abstractions of the real world application. We evaluate the capabilities of each technology and conclude that a constraint-based scheduling approach, specifically a decomposition using constraint programming, provides the most promising results for our application. PDDL-based planning is able to find mostly low quality solutions while the timeline approach was unable to model the full problem without alterations to the solver code, thus moving away from the model-and-solve paradigm. It would be misleading to conclude that constraint programming is ``better'' than PDDL-based planning in a general sense, both because we have examined a single application and because the approaches make different assumptions about the knowledge one is allowed to embed in a model. Nonetheless, we believe our investigation is valuable for AI planning and scheduling researchers as it highlights these different modelling assumptions and provides insight into avenues for the application of AI planning and scheduling for similar robotics problems. In particular, as constraint programming has not been widely applied to robot planning and scheduling in the literature, our results suggest significant untapped potential in doing so.},

An open-ended topic guide and a modified Alice Cares documentary focused discussions. The Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL) guided data analysis.Data revealed older adults’ multidimensional perceptions on the ethics of SARs which were structured along three sections: (a) SARs as components of a techno-societal evolution, (b) SARs’ embeddedness in aged-care dynamics, (c) SARs as embodiments of ethical considerations.Perceptions sociohistorically contextualize the ethics of SAR use by older adults’ views on societal, organizational, and relational contexts in which aged care takes place. These contexts need to inform the ethical criteria for the design, development, and use of SARs. Focusing on older adults’ ethical perceptions creates “normativity in place,” viewing participants as moral subjects.},

However, the deployment of robots able to physically interact with a person in an assistive manner is still a challenging problem. Apart from the design and control, the robot must be able to adapt to the user it is attending in order to become a useful tool for caregivers. This robot behavior adaptation comes through the definition of user preferences for the task such that the robot can act in the user's desired way. This article presents a taxonomy of user preferences for assistive scenarios, including physical interactions, that may be used to improve robot decision-making algorithms. The taxonomy categorizes the preferences based on their semantics and possible uses. We propose the categorization in two levels of application (global and specific) as well as two types (primary and modifier). Examples of real preference classifications are presented in three assistive tasks: feeding, shoe fitting and coat dressing.},

In this narrative review, we address the unique patient-clinician-robot triad, and argue that this context calls for specific design features in order to foster trust with the users. We review pertinent methods for measuring trust, and studies demonstrating that culture, prior experience and propensity-to-trust affect to what extent users trust robots. We suggest design guidelines for fostering trust and methods for measuring trust in human-robot interactions in rehabilitation. We stress the need to create measures of trust that are accessible to people who suffer from speech or cognitive impairments.

Where humans and robots are working as partners, the performance of the work can be diminished if humans do not trust robots appropriately. Considering the impact of human-robot trust observed in different HRI fields, many researchers have investigated the field of human-robot trust and examined various concerns related to human-robot trust. In this work, we review the past works on human-robot trust based on the research topics and discuss selected trends in this field.

As a result, human- robot trust can directly affect people's willingness to cooperate with the robot, while under- or overreliance could have severe or even dangerous consequences. Problematically, investigating trust and human perceptions of safety in HRI experiments is not a straightforward task and, in light of a number of ethical concerns and risks, proves quite challenging.

This fact is highly related to the physical and cognitive decline of aged people, influencing the way they apprehend their environment and, thus, their daily activities. Towards this direction, the “Robotic Assistant for MCI patients at home” (RAMCIP) project, initiated by the European Union, intends to build a service robot that will operate in domestic environments with the aim to proactively and discreetly support older persons and MCI patients. The key component to achieve this goal is the design of a robot endowed with high-level cognitive functions, driven by advanced human and environment perception mechanisms, that will enable the artificial agent to autonomously decide when and how to assist. The paper in hand demonstrates the RAMCIP concept through identified user requirements and provides an overall system description. Additionally, the architecture design of the robotic system is exhibited here, firstly by providing a conceptual analysis and then by further decomposing the identified modules into functional components.

	abstract = {One option to address the challenge of demographic transition is to build robots that enable aging in place. Falling has been identified as the most relevant factor to cause a move to a care facility. The Hobbit project combines research from robotics, gerontology, and human–robot interaction to develop a care robot which is capable of fall prevention and detection as well as emergency detection and handling. Moreover, to enable daily interaction with the robot, other functions are added, such as bringing objects, offering reminders, and entertainment. The interaction with the user is based on a multimodal user interface including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, gesture recognition, and a graphical touch-based user interface. We performed controlled laboratory user studies with a total of 49 participants (aged 70 plus) in three EU countries (Austria, Greece, and Sweden). The collected user responses on perceived usability, acceptance, and affordability of the robot demonstrate a positive reception of the robot from its target user group. This article describes the principles and system components for navigation and manipulation in domestic environments, the interaction paradigm and its implementation in a multimodal user interface, the core robot tasks, as well as the results from the user studies, which are also reflected in terms of lessons we learned and we believe are useful to fellow researchers.},

	abstract = {Lio is a mobile robot platform with a multi-functional arm explicitly designed for human-robot interaction and personal care assistant tasks. The robot has already been deployed in several health care facilities, where it is functioning autonomously, assisting staff and patients on an everyday basis. Lio is intrinsically safe by having full coverage in soft artificial-leather material as well as collision detection, limited speed and forces. Furthermore, the robot has a compliant motion controller. A combination of visual, audio, laser, ultrasound and mechanical sensors are used for safe navigation and environment understanding. The ROS-enabled setup allows researchers to access raw sensor data as well as have direct control of the robot. The friendly appearance of Lio has resulted in the robot being well accepted by health care staff and patients. Fully autonomous operation is made possible by a flexible decision engine, autonomous navigation and automatic recharging. Combined with time-scheduled task triggers, this allows Lio to operate throughout the day, with a battery life of up to 8 hours and recharging during idle times. A combination of powerful computing units provides enough processing power to deploy artificial intelligence and deep learning-based solutions on-board the robot without the need to send any sensitive data to cloud services, guaranteeing compliance with privacy requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lio was rapidly adjusted to perform additional functionality like disinfection and remote elevated body temperature detection. It complies with ISO13482 - Safety requirements for personal care robots, meaning it can be directly tested and deployed in care facilities.},

	abstract = {There are great physical and cognitive benefits for older adults who are engaged in active aging, a process that should involve daily exercise. In our previous work on the PHysical Assistant RObot System (PHAROS), we developed a system that proposed and monitored physical activities. The system used a social robot to analyse, by means of computer vision, the exercise a person was doing. Then, a recommender system analysed the exercise performed and indicated what exercise to perform next. However, the system needed certain improvements. On the one hand, the vision system captured the movement of the person and indicated whether the exercise had been done correctly or not. On the other hand, the recommender system was based purely on a ranking system that did not take into account temporal evolution and preferences. In this work, we propose an evolution of PHAROS, PHAROS 2.0, incorporating improvements in both of the previously mentioned aspects. In the motion capture aspect, we are now able to indicate the degree of completeness of each exercise, identifying the part that has not been done correctly, and a real-time performance correction. In this way, the recommender system receives a greater amount of information and so can more accurately indicate the exercise to be performed. In terms of the recommender system, an algorithm was developed to weigh the performance, temporal evolution and preferences, providing a more accurate recommendation, as well as expanding the recommendation to a batch of exercises, instead of just one.},

We divide trust into two categories, performance-based trust and relation-based trust, and examine how the definitions, questions, and measures fall into those two categories. We also examine how these two categories of trust line up across definition, question, and measure for a given paper. We found a conflation between performance-based trust and relation-based trust, and that while there is an interest in asking relation-based trust questions, there is a lack of objective means of measuring that trust. We offer recommendations for the formalization of trust, objective experimental paradigms, and trust-related questions to investigate.},

	abstract = {Gone are the days of robots solely operating in isolation, without direct interaction with people. Rather, robots are increasingly being deployed in environments and roles that require complex social interaction with humans. The implementation of human-robot teams continues to increase as technology develops in tandem with the state of human-robot interaction (HRI) research. Trust, a major component of human interaction, is an important facet of HRI. However, the ideas of trust repair and trust violations are understudied in the HRI literature. Trust repair is the activity of rebuilding trust after one party breaks the trust of another. These trust breaks are referred to as trust violations. Just as with humans, trust violations with robots are inevitable; as a result, a clear understanding of the process of HRI trust repair must be developed in order to ensure that a human-robot team can continue to perform well after a trust violation. Previous research on human-automation trust and human-human trust can serve as starting places for exploring trust repair in HRI. Although existing models of human-automation and human-human trust are helpful, they do not account for some of the complexities of building and maintaining trust in unique relationships between humans and robots. The purpose of this article is to provide a foundation for exploring human-robot trust repair by drawing upon prior work in the human-robot, human-automation, and human-human trust literature, concluding with recommendations for advancing this body of work.},

The ethical evaluation of care robots requires insight into the values at stake in the healthcare tradition. What's more, given the stage of their development and lack of standards provided by the International Organization for Standardization to guide their development, ethics ought to be included into the design process of such robots. The manner in which this may be accomplished, as presented here, uses the blueprint of the Value-sensitive design approach as a means for creating a framework tailored to care contexts. Using care values as the foundational values to be integrated into a technology and using the elements in care, from the care ethics perspective, as the normative criteria, the resulting approach may be referred to as care centered value-sensitive design. The framework proposed here allows for the ethical evaluation of care robots both retrospectively and prospectively. By evaluating care robots in this way, we may ultimately ask what kind of care we, as a society, want to provide in the future.},

A quick survey of the current trends in this domain reveals that, while tremendous progress has been made in the development of assistive robots for the feeding of solid foods, the task of feeding liquids from a cup remains largely underdeveloped. Therefore, this paper describes an assistive robot that focuses specifically on the feeding of liquids from a cup using tactile feedback through force sensors with direct human–robot interaction (HRI). The main focus of this paper is the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to learn what the best robotic actions are, based on the force applied by the user. A model of the application environment is developed based on the Markov decision process and a software training procedure is designed for quick development and testing. Five of the commonly used RL algorithms are investigated, with the intention of finding the best fit for training, and the system is tested in an experimental study. The preliminary results show a high degree of acceptance by the participants. Feedback from the users indicates that the assistive robot functions intuitively and effectively.},

The drinking task has a high priority and requires constant assistance by caregivers to be executed regularly. Due to incapacitating disabilities such as tetraplegia, which is the paralysis of all limbs, affected people cannot use classic control interfaces such as joysticks. This paper presents a robotic solution to enable independent, straw-less drinking using a smart cup and no physically attached elements on the user. The system's hardware and software components are presented and the overarching control scheme described. The cup approaches the mouth utilising a user-friendly and vision-based robot control based on head pose estimation. Once contact has been established, the user can drink by tilting the cup with a force sensor-based control setup. Two experimental studies have been conducted, where the participants (mostly able-bodied and one tetraplegic), could separately experience the cup's contactless approach and the contact-based sequence. First results show a high user acceptance rate and consistent positive feedback. The evaluation of internal data showed a high reliability of the safety-critical components with the test groups perceiving the system as intuitive and easy to use.},

Individuals need to achieve a high level of self-efficacy in human robot-interaction in a reasonable time-frame for positive effects to occur in short-term human-robot scenarios. This trial explored the impact of a 2-minute automated robot-delivered tutorial designed to teach people from the general public how to use the robot as a method to increase robot self-efficacy scores. This trial assessed scores before (T1) and after (T2) an interaction with the robot to investigate changes in self-efficacy, likability and willingness to use it. The 40 participants recruited had on average very low level of robotic experience. After the tutorial, people reported significantly higher robot self-efficacy with very large effect sizes to operate a robot and apply the robot to a task (\${\textbackslash}eta \_p{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.727\$ and 0.660). Significant increases in likability and willingness to interact with the robot were also found (\${\textbackslash}eta \_p{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.465\$ and 0.480). Changes in likability and self-efficacy contributed to 64\% of the variance in changes to willingness to use the robot. Initial differences were found in robot self-efficacy for older people and those with less robotics and programming experience compared with other participants, but scores across these subgroups were similar after completion of the tutorial. This demonstrated that high levels of self-efficacy, likeability and willingness to use a social robot can be reached in a very short time, and on comparable levels, regardless of age or prior robotics experience. This outcome has significant implications for future trials using social robots, since these variables can strongly influence experimental outcomes.},

A modern conception of human-robot trust must go beyond the conventional notions of human-automation relations and better connect to the current understanding of humanhuman trust, without assuming that human-robot trust is identical. A review of the literature together with our recent empirical work suggest that trust is multi-dimensional, incorporating both performance aspects (central in the human-automation literature) and moral aspects (central in the human-human trust literature). A multi-dimensional conception can be applied to humanrobot trust, even if only some of the dimensions will be relevant for any given interaction with a robot. In addition to proposing an integrative conception of trust, we offer a measurement instrument for public use: the Multi-Dimensional Measure of Trust (MDMT). This measure captures two superordinate factors of trust (Performance trust, Moral trust) that each break into two subfacets (Reliable and Capable within Performance, and Sincere and Ethical within Moral). We are continuing to test this measure in follow-up research and encourage other researchers to join us in collectively validating it.},

Previous studies have analyzed how robot failure affects human trust, but not in the context of the human teaching the robot. In this paper, we investigate how human teachers react to robot failure in an LfD setting. We conduct a study in which participants teach a robot how to complete three tasks, using one of three instruction methods, while the robot is pre-programmed to either succeed or fail at the task. We find that when the robot fails, people trust the robot less (p {\textless} .001\$) and themselves less (p=.004) and they believe that others will trust them less (p {\textless} .001\$). Human teachers also have a lower impression of the robot and themselves (p {\textless} .001) and found the task more difficult when the robot fails (p {\textless} .001\$). Motion capture was found to be a less difficult instruction method than teleoperation (p=.016), while kinesthetic teaching gave the teachers the lowest impression of themselves compared to teleoperation (p=.017) and motion capture (p {\textless} .001). Importantly, a mediation analysis showed that people's trust in themselves is heavily mediated by what they think that others -- including the robot -- think of them (p {\textless} .001). These results provide valuable insights to improving the human-robot relationship for LfD.},

In the first year, the aim was to monitor and evaluate how the care robot is used in daily practice. In the second year, the focus was on evaluating whether the use of Zora by care professionals can be extended to more groups and other type of clients. Interviews, questionnaires and observations were used as instruments to reveal the progress in the use of the robot and to reveal the facilitators and barriers. Care professionals experienced several barriers in the use of the robot (e.g., start-up time and software failures). The opportunity they had to discuss their experience during project team meetings was seen as a facilitator in the project. Furthermore, they mentioned that the Zora robot had a positive influence on clients as it created added value for the care professionals in having fun at work.},

We conduct a mixed-design user study with multiple robots to investigate trust, inappropriate reliance, and compliance measures in the context of a time-constrained game. We also examine how the effect of human accountability addresses errors due to over-compliance in the context of human robot interaction (HRI). This study is novel as it involves examining multiple attributes at once, thus enabling us to perform multi-way comparisons between different attributes on trust and compliance with the agent. Results from the 4x4x2x2 study show that behavior and anthropomorphism of the agent are the most significant factors in predicting the trust and compliance with the robot. Furthermore, adding a coalition-building preface, where the agent provides context to why it might make errors while giving advice, leads to an increase in trust for specific behaviors of the agent.},

This work analyzes the adoption of e-government services and proposes that trust and personal values contribute to better understand such adoption. Specifically, this study proposes an integration of trust into the TAM, due to the online context characteristics (i.e., uncertainty). In addition, since these services are provided to the whole citizenry, two personal values very much related to e-government advantages (citizens’ time consciousness and environmental concern) are proposed as moderators of the aforementioned relationships. Results reveal the mediating role of trust into the TAM framework which is confirmed by a rival models analysis. Besides, citizens’ personal values moderate the influence of some antecedents of the intention to use e-government services, which suggests some interesting implications for public administration strategic marketing.
Resumen
El Modelo de Aceptación Tecnológica (TAM) es conocido por ser uno de los mejores marcos conceptuales que puede adaptarse a las características de diferentes escenarios de adopción tecnológica. Este trabajo analiza la adopción de servicios de administración electrónica y propone que la confianza y los valores personales contribuyen a entender mejor este proceso. Concretamente, dada las características del entorno online y la variedad de usuarios potenciales, se propone una integración de la confianza en el TAM y se analiza como dos valores personales de los ciudadanos (la conciencia de tiempo y la conciencia medioambiental) moderan las relaciones anteriores en este contexto. Los resultados revelan que la confianza desempeña un papel mediador en el modelo TAM, lo que se confirma con el análisis de modelos rivales. Asimismo, los valores personales moderan la influencia de las variables TAM sobre la intención de uso, sugiriendo algunas implicaciones de interés para el marketing estratégico de las Administraciones Públicas.},

	abstract = {Trust and risk have often been linked in the literature, but their relationship is far from clear. Trust has been used in three different ways — namely, as a perception (“subjective trust”), as various personal and situational factors that lead to subjective trust (“trust antecedents”), and as the actions resulting from subjective trust (“behavioral trust”). We explain how risk is related to these three conceptions of trust. First, we argue that subjective trust and perceived risk are in fact mirror images of each other. Second, we show how behavioral trust can be viewed as risk taking, so that the causal relationship between subjective trust and behavioral trust is similar to that of perceived risk and risk taking. And third, we discuss the role of personal characteristics (such as risk propensity and trust propensity) in the risk–trust relationship. We also develop a number of propositions based on our risk-based view of trust.},

Results indicate that repairing trust is generally more difficult with groups than individuals, and both groups and individuals were less trusting when trustees denied culpability (rather than apologized) for a competence-based violation or apologized (rather than denied culpability) for an integrity-based violation. However, the interaction of violation-type and violation-response also ultimately affected the relative difficulty of repairing trust with groups vs. individuals, with the greater harshness of groups dissipating when the transgressors’ responses were effectively matched with the type of violation. Persuasive argumentation rather than normative pressure, furthermore, mediated these differences. Thus, the sequencing of individual vs. group assessments mattered, such that subsequent group assessments affected initial individual assessments but not the reverse.},

We conduct a 10-condition user study involving 200 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate the effects of providing noisy and noise-free diagnosis suggestions and/or action recommendations to operators. We find that although action recommendations (feedforward) have a greater effect on successful error resolution than diagnosis information (feedback), the feedback likely helps ameliorate the deleterious effects of noise. Therefore, we find that error recovery interfaces should display both diagnosis and action recommendations for maximum effectiveness.},
