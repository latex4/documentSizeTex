In the years following Jobs' announcement, the use of Flash declined precipitously. However, using data from an online labor market, we show there was no detectable reduction in Flash hourly wages or even in the number of applicants per Flash job. We show that the reason wages stayed flat was that the negative demand shock for Flash quickly became a supply shock: Flash specialists transitioned away from Flash, and new market entrants were less likely to specialize in Flash. A retrospective survey of affected Flash workers reveals them to be highly forward-looking, abandoning skills with no perceived future and picking up new skills, primarily through learning-by-doing. The implications for the spread of new technologies that require complementary labor are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a framework for understanding the effects of automation and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital and labor-the task content of production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task content of production in favor of labor because of a reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of production-due to automation and new tasks-can be inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.},

- new technologies not only increase productivity of capital and labor at the tasks they currently perform, but also impact the allocation of tasks to these factors of production (task content of production)
- technically it's not the allocation of tasks to these but rather that of skills
- automation corresponds to development and adoption of new technologies that enable capital to be substituted for labor in a range of tasks
- displacement (automation reduces the labor share of value added) and productivity effects (automation contributes to demand for labor in non-automated tasks)

- Automation technologies that threaten employment and wages the most are 'so-so' technologies (only small productivity effects, i.e. automated customer service) instead of the brilliant ones
- automation technologies adopted in response to the scarcity of workers in countries where labor force is aging rapidly (i.e. Germany, Japan), appear to have more positive effects than in the US. Labor scarcity encourages automation

abstract = {We examine the concerns that new technologies will render labor redundant in a framework in which tasks previously performed by labor can be automated and new versions of existing tasks, in which labor has a comparative advantage, can be created. In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research towards automation and the creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster automation and introduction of new tasks, and characterize the conditions under which inequality is increasing or stable in the long run.},

abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) jobs are a key contributor to economic growth and national competitiveness. Yet STEM workers are perceived to be in short supply. This paper shows that the "STEM shortage" phenomenon is explained by technological change, which introduces new job tasks and makes old ones obsolete. We find that the initially high economic return to applied STEM degrees declines by more than 50 percent in the first decade of working life. This coincides with a rapid exit of college graduates from STEM occupations. Using detailed job vacancy data, we show that STEM jobs changed especially quickly over the last decade, leading to flatter age-earnings profiles as the skills of older cohorts became obsolete. Our findings highlight the importance of technology-specific skills in explaining life-cycle returns to education, and show that STEM jobs are the leading edge of technology diffusion in the labor market. * Emails: david{\_}deming@harvard.edu; knoray@g.harvard.edu.

abstract = {Economic inequality is one of the biggest challenges facing society today. Inequality has been recently exacerbated by growth in high-and low-wage occupations at the expense of middle-wage occupations, leading to a "hollowing" of the middle class. Yet, our understanding of how workplace skills drive this process is limited. Specifically, how do skill requirements distinguish high-and low-wage occupations, and does this distinction constrain the mobility of individuals and urban labor markets? Using unsupervised clustering techniques from network science, we show that skills exhibit a striking polarization into two clusters that highlight the specific social-cognitive skills and sensory-physical skills of high-and low-wage occupations, respectively. The connections between skills explain various dynamics: how workers transition between occupations, how cities acquire comparative advantage in new skills, and how individual occupations change their skill requirements. We also show that the polarized skill topology constrains the career mobility of individual workers, with low-skill workers "stuck" relying on the low-wage skill set. Together, these results provide a new explanation for the persistence of occupational polarization and inform strategies to mitigate the negative effects of automation and offshoring of employment. In addition to our analysis, we provide an online tool for the public and policy makers to explore the skill network: skillscape.mit.edu.},

abstract = {To study the effects of new information technologies (IT) on productivity, we have assembled a unique data set on plants in one narrowly denned industry — valve manufacturing — and analyze several plant-level mechanisms through which IT could promote productivity growth. The empirical analysis reveals three main results. First, plants that adopt new IT-enhanced equipment also shift their business strategies by producing more customized valve products. Second, new IT investments improve the efficiency of all stages of the production process by reducing setup times, run times, and inspection times. The reductions in setup times are theoretically important because they make it less costly to switch production from one product to another and support the change in business strategy to more customized production. Third, adoption of new IT-enhanced capital equipment coincides with increases in the skill requirements of machine operators, notably technical and problem-solving skills, and with the adoption of new human resource practices to support these skills.

abstract = {We apply an understanding ofwhat computers do to study how computerization alters job skill demands.We argue that computer capital (1) substitutes for workers in performing cognitive and manual tasks that can be accomplished by following explicit rules; and (2) complements workers in performing nonroutine problem- solving and complex communications tasks. Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We ?nd that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is asso- ciated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative de- mand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nomi- nally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {This paper argues that several of the poor labor market outcomes observed in the Great Recession can be traced back to a change in the demand pattern for skilled workers that started with the tech bust of 2000. In particular, we show that around the year 2000, the demand for cognitive tasks underwent a reversal. In response, high-skilled workers moved down the occupational ladder and increasingly displaced lower-educated workers in less skill-intensive jobs. While these effects were present before the financial crisis of 2008, they became more obvious after jobs associated with the housing bubble disappeared.},

@article{AutorDorn2013,
abstract = {We offer a unified analysis of the growth of low-skill service occupations between 1980 and 2005 and the concurrent polarization of US employment and wages. We hypothesize that polarization stems from the interaction between consumer preferences, which favor variety over specialization, and the falling cost of automating routine, codifiable job tasks. Applying a spatial equilibrium model, we corroborate four implications of this hypothesis. Local labor markets that specialized in routine tasks differentially adopted information technology, reallocated low-skill labor into service occupations (employment polarization), experienced earnings growth at the tails of the distribution (wage polarization), and received inflows of skilled labor. (JEL J24, J31, R23) A vast literature documents a pronounced rise in wage inequality in the United States and numerous other advanced nations commencing in the 1980s and pro-poses skill-biased technological change as its primary cause. The intellectual foun-dation of this literature is what Acemoglu and Autor (2011) refer to as the canonical model, which features two distinct skill groups—typically, college and high school workers—performing two distinct and imperfectly substitutable occupations or pro-ducing two imperfectly substitutable goods.},

@article{Michaels2014,
abstract = {We test the hypothesis that information and communication technologies (ICT) polarize labor markets by increasing demand for the highly educated at the expense of the middle educated, with little effect on low-educated workers. Using data on the United States, Japan, and nine European countries from 1980 to 2004, we find that industries with faster ICT growth shifted demand from middle-educated workers to highly educated workers, consistent with ICT-based polarization. Trade openness is also associated with polarization, but this is not robust to controlling for R{\&}D. Technologies account for up to a quarter of the growth in demand for highly educated workers.},

@article{GoosManningSalomons2014,
abstract = {This paper documents the pervasiveness of job polarization in 16 Western European countries over the period 1993–2010. It then develops and estimates a framework to explain job polarization using routine-biased technological change and offshoring. This model can explain much of both total job polarization and the split into within-industry and between-industry components. (JEL J21, J23, J24, M55, O33) The " Skill-Biased Technological Change " hypothesis (SBTC)—see Katz and Autor (1999); Goldin and Katz (2008, 2009); and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) for excellent overviews—arose from the observation that demand is shifting in favor of more educated workers. In spite of its success in explaining many decades of data, however, SBTC cannot explain the recent phenomenon of job polarization as documented by Autor, Katz, and Kearney (2006, 2008) and Autor and Dorn (2013) for the United States and Goos and Manning (2007) for the United Kingdom. Job polarization has also been documented for Germany (Spitz-Oener 2006; Dustmann, Ludsteck, and Sch{\"{o}}nberg 2009) and there are indications it is pervasive in European countries (Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2009; Michaels, Natraj, and Van Reenen 2014). The first contribution of this paper is to show that job polarization is pervasive across advanced economies by showing it holds in 16 Western European countries. The main hypotheses put forward to explain job polarization are that recent tech-nological change is biased toward replacing labor in routine tasks (what we call rou-tine-biased technological change (RBTC)) and that there is task offshoring (itself partially influenced by technological change), and that both of these forces decrease the demand for middling relative to high-skilled and low-skilled occupations (Autor, Levy, and Murnane 2003; Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2006, 2008; Goos and Manning 2007; Autor and Dorn 2013). The second contribution of this paper is to develop and estimate a model—that has its roots in the canonical model first developed},
