    abstract = "Active Learning (AL) has been successfully applied to Deep Learning in order to drastically reduce the amount of data required to achieve high performance. Previous works have shown that lightweight architectures for Named Entity Recognition (NER) can achieve optimal performance with only 25{\%} of the original training data. However, these methods do not exploit the sequential nature of language and the heterogeneity of uncertainty within each instance, requiring the labelling of whole sentences. Additionally, this standard method requires that the annotator has access to the full sentence when labelling. In this work, we overcome these limitations by allowing the AL algorithm to query subsequences within sentences, and propagate their labels to other sentences. We achieve highly efficient results on OntoNotes 5.0, only requiring 13{\%} of the original training data, and CoNLL 2003, requiring only 27{\%}. This is an improvement of 39{\%} and 37{\%} compared to querying full sentences.",

Both of these traditional objective functions for the NER problem generally produce adequate performance when the data distribution is balanced and there are sufficient annotated training examples. But since NER is inherently an imbalanced tagging problem, the model performance under the low-resource settings could suffer using these standard objective functions. Based on recent advances in area under the ROC curve (AUC) maximization, we propose to optimize the NER model by maximizing the AUC score. We give evidence that by simply combining two binary-classifiers that maximize the AUC score, significant performance improvement over traditional loss functions is achieved under low-resource NER settings. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the advantages of our method under the low-resource and highly-imbalanced data distribution settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that brings AUC maximization to the NER setting. Furthermore, we show that our method is agnostic to different types of NER embeddings, models and domains.

    abstract = "Domain adaptation is an effective solution to data scarcity in low-resource scenarios. However, when applied to token-level tasks such as bioNER, domain adaptation methods often suffer from the challenging linguistic characteristics that clinical narratives possess, which leads to unsatsifactory performance. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective hardness-guided domain adaptation framework for bioNER tasks that can effectively leverage the domain hardness information to improve the adaptability of the learnt model in the low-resource scenarios. Experimental results on biomedical datasets show that our model can achieve significant performance improvement over the recently published state-of-the-art (SOTA) MetaNER model.",
